# Dross Executioner

## Card Type Line
Creature — Zombie Assassin

## Rules Text
> When Dross Executioner enters the battlefield, target creature gets -2/-2 until end of turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Dross has its own justice."*

## Image Prompt
> A skeletal assassin emerging from toxic mist, blackened blade dripping with corrosive ichor.

## Design Notes
- Black common creature - addresses Black common gap (-6)
- ETB removal for black common
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Dross (Mephidross)]]
- Pairs with: [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]], [[Reprocessing Agent]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Panharmonicon]] doubles ETB giving -4/-4 total; [[Thassa, Deep-Dwelling]] repeated -2/-2 every end step; [[Conjurer's Closet]] blink for repeated removal
- **Potential Combos:** [[Yarok, the Desecrated]] triples ETB in Sultai; [[Cloudstone Curio]] bounce and replay for repeated triggers; [[Nim Deathmantle]] sacrifice and return for repeated ETBs
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - ETB -2/-2 is a common effect at this cost. Strong with blink but not broken
