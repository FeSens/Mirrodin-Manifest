### Design goals

- Represent **interest-on-interest**
    
- Scale inequality
    
- Reward early advantage
    
- Be narrower and more surgical than Proliferate
    
- Synergize explosively with Sagas and counters

## ✅ **Core Definition (Clean & Rules-Safe)**

### **Compound — keyword action**

> **Compound — Choose a permanent. Put a counter on it of a type already on it.**

That’s the whole mechanic.  
Minimal text. Maximum consequences.

## 📜 Reminder Text (for commons)

> _(To compound, choose a permanent and add a counter to it of a type already on it.)_

## 🎭 Flavor Home Run

- Value accumulates where value already exists
    
- No redistribution
    
- No fairness
    
- Pure exponential growth
    

Compound is the **enemy of Redistribute**, mechanically and philosophically.

## 🔁 Why Compound Is Not Proliferate

|Proliferate|Compound|
|---|---|
|Many targets|One target|
|Optional per permanent|Mandatory|
|Broad|Focused|
|Egalitarian|Asymmetric|

This distinction is _crucial_ — Compound feels predatory.

## 🔥 Example Cards

### **Market Momentum**

> Whenever you win a gamble, compound.

### **Speculative Bubble**

> At the beginning of your upkeep, compound.  
> When this permanent has five or more counters, sacrifice it.

Boom-and-bust design.

## ⚠️ Balance Notes

- Repeated free Compound is dangerous (on purpose)
    
- Sagas + Compound accelerate chapters — limit carefully
    
- Best placed at **uncommon+**, with few engines at common

# 🧠 **The Mechanical Triangle (Set Identity)**

|Mechanic|Philosophy|Gameplay Effect|
|---|---|---|
|**Gamble**|Risk & volatility|Creates variance|
|**Compound**|Capital accumulation|Amplifies inequality|
|**Redistribute**|Forced equality|Destroys efficiency|

This triangle is **exceptionally strong set design**.  
Each mechanic:

- Counters the others
    
- Creates political tension
    
- Teaches ideology _through gameplay_
