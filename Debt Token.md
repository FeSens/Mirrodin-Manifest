# Debt Token

## Card Type Line
Token Artifact — Debt

## Rules Text
> *(Debt tokens enter the battlefield with a debt counter on them.)*
>
> At the beginning of your upkeep, you lose life equal to the number of debt counters on this permanent, then sacrifice it.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Foundry giveth. The Foundry taketh away—with interest."*

## Image Prompt
> A dark chrome contract scroll hovering ominously, covered in red glowing runes representing accumulating debt. Chains made of numbers and symbols wrap around it, pulling downward. The scroll drips with a viscous red liquid representing the life being drained. Oppressive corporate aesthetic, MTG token art style, ominous and foreboding.

## Design Notes
- Created by: [[Loan Shark]], [[Predatory Lending]], [[Myr Repo Unit]], and other debt-creating cards
- Enters with 1 debt counter (deals 1 damage by default)
- Synergies:
  - [[COMPOUND]] adds debt counters → more damage
  - [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] moves debt counters between Debt tokens
  - [[Hype Cycle]] doubles debt counters → double damage
  - [[Market Crash]] removes all counters → 0 damage (debt cleared!)
- Cross-format interactions:
  - Sacrifice outlets (Ashnod's Altar) can avoid damage (costs resource)
  - Proliferate adds debt counters (downside of proliferating)
  - Artifact synergies (Affinity) count Debt = leveraging debt for gain
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - The Credit Crisis of Mirrodin
- Thematic opposite of [[Gold Token]] - paper promises vs. real value
- Pairs with: [[Collection Agent]], [[Master of Debt]], [[Central Bank Governor]], [[Vulture Capitalist]]
