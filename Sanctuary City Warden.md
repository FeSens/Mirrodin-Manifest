# Sanctuary City Warden

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Cleric

## Rules Text
> Creatures you control can't be exiled by spells or abilities opponents control.
>
> Whenever a creature would be exiled from under your control, instead put a refuge counter on it. It gains hexproof as long as it has a refuge counter on it.
>
> *"Not from this city. Not on my watch."*

## Flavor Text
> *"The Foundry's reach ends at our gates."*

## Image Prompt
> A defiant cleric standing before a city gate, arms spread protectively. Refugees gather behind them. Sanctuary against deportation.

## Design Notes
- Anti-exile protection
- Counter synergy: Refuge counters provide hexproof, [[Hype Cycle]] doubles, [[COMPOUND]] adds
- Counter to Mer-Ikan deportation theme
- Selesnya sanctuary city flavor
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - sanctuary cities resisting deportation
- Pairs with: [[Hidden Community Elder]], [[DREAM Act Advocate]], [[Asylum Seeker]]
