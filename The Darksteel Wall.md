# The Darksteel Wall

## Card Type Line
Legendary Artifact

## Rules Text
> Indestructible
>
> Creatures entering the battlefield under opponents' control enter tapped.
>
> Creatures your opponents control that weren't cast from their hand can't attack.
>
> At the beginning of your upkeep, each opponent who controls a creature that wasn't cast from their hand loses 2 life. You gain life equal to the life lost this way.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Mephidross will pay for it. One extracted ore at a time."*
> — Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel

## Image Prompt
> A colossal wall of seamless darksteel stretching across the horizon, separating the gleaming Great Furnace territory from the toxic swamps of the Mephidross. Desperate figures claw at the base while armored Mer-Ikan sentries patrol the top. Tromp's gilded silhouette stands atop a watchtower. Metallic silver wall contrasting with sickly green Mephidross atmosphere. Epic scale, MTG card art style, imposing and oppressive.

## Design Notes
- Indestructible fits darksteel flavor and the "unbreakable wall" narrative
- Punishes token strategies, reanimation, and cheating creatures into play
- Life drain represents "making them pay for it"
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - Tromp's signature project
- Mythic rare power level for a build-around
