# Core-Logic Architect

## Card Type Line
Creature — Vedalken Artificer

## Rules Text
> When Core-Logic Architect enters the battlefield, put two calculation counters on target artifact you control.
>
> Artifacts you control with counters on them have "{T}: Draw a card, then discard a card."

## Flavor Text
> *"The Myr don't think. They calculate. The distinction is irrelevant."*

## Image Prompt
> A tall Vedalken in pristine white robes standing before a massive holographic schematic of the En-Vidia Lattice. Their four arms manipulate different sections of the display simultaneously. Myr units stand motionless behind them, awaiting instructions. Cold blue lighting, clinical atmosphere.

## Design Notes
- Enables artifact-counter synergies
- Calculation counters are a new counter type for the AI theme
- Looting on artifacts with counters rewards [[COMPOUND]]/[[Hype Cycle]]
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]] - Core-Logic designers
- Pairs with: [[En-Vidia Processing Core]], [[Sal-Tman, Prophet of the Core-Logic]], [[Lattice Overseer]]
