# Bubble Speculator

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Advisor

## Rules Text
> When Bubble Speculator enters the battlefield, put three bubble counters on target permanent.
>
> At the beginning of each upkeep, double the number of bubble counters on permanents you control.
>
> When a permanent with five or more bubble counters on it has its counters removed, sacrifice it.

## Flavor Text
> *"It's not a bubble if it never pops."*

## Image Prompt
> A nervous-looking human watching floating bubbles that contain swirling counters. Each bubble grows larger, more unstable. Inevitable collapse.

## Design Notes
- Bubble counters double each turn (exponential growth)
- [[Market Crash]] pops all bubbles (sacrifice when counters removed)
- Creates tension with counter manipulation
- Financial bubble/crash mechanic
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] accelerates bubble growth dangerously
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Great Doubt (The AI Hype Correction)]] - speculative bubbles
- Pairs with: [[Hedge Fund Manager]], [[Inflation Harbinger]], [[Trough of Disillusionment]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Clockspinning]] add/remove counters selectively; [[The Ozolith]] stores counters; [[Solemnity]] prevents bubble growth
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** Can target OPPONENT'S permanents with bubble counters, then [[Vampire Hexmage]]/[[Aether Snap]] removes counters = force sacrifice of any permanent; 2-card combo to destroy any permanent
- **Balance Assessment:** BROKEN - The ability to target opponent's permanents then force sacrifice via counter removal is too powerful. Consider "target permanent you control" restriction
