# Inflation Harbinger

## Card Type Line
Creature — Spirit

## Rules Text
> Haste
>
> When Inflation Harbinger enters the battlefield, put a -1/-1 counter on each creature with a +1/+1 counter on it.

## Flavor Text
> *"Your savings? Worth less every day."*

## Image Prompt
> A fiery spirit swooping through a marketplace, leaving wilting value in its wake. Prices rise as it passes. Economic devastation.

## Design Notes
- Punishes +1/+1 counter strategies
- Inflation "devalues" existing gains - counters [[COMPOUND]] strategies
- Red's destructive economics
- Common economic hate card
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Great Doubt (The AI Hype Correction)]] - economic instability
- -1/-1 counters synergize with [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] (spread the debuffs)
- Pairs with: [[Market Crash]], [[Bubble Speculator]], [[Quantitative Easer]], [[Simulated Labor Myr]]
