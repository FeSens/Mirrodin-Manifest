# Hedge

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Prevent all damage that would be dealt this turn.
>
> Create a Gold token. *(It's an artifact that enters with a value counter. It has "Sacrifice this artifact: Add {C} for each value counter on it.")*

## Flavor Text
> *"When the Lattice burns, those with gold walk away whole."*
> — Glimmervoid Investment Doctrine

## Image Prompt
> A Vedalken financier standing calm within a protective bubble of golden light while chaos erupts around them. Explosions, collapsing structures, and panicked creatures are frozen mid-destruction outside the barrier. The financier casually examines a gold ingot in their hand. Serene gold tones inside the bubble contrasting with violent reds and blacks outside. MTG card art style, financial sanctuary, eye of the storm.

## Design Notes
- Reference cards: [[Holy Day]] ({W}, combat only), [[Safe Passage]] ({2}{W}, you and creatures)
- This prevents ALL damage symmetrically (broader but helps opponents too)
- Gold token adds set flavor and small value for hedging your investment
- {1}{W} is fair for symmetrical effect + minor upside
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - The Aurum Surge / Glimmervoid gold as safe haven
- "Hedge" = financial term for risk mitigation, perfect for the economic themes
- White's protection + artifact/gold synergy
