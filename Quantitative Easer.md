# Quantitative Easer

Creature — Vedalken Wizard

## Rules Text
> {T}: Put a value counter on each Gold token you control.
>
> {2}{U}, {T}: Create two Gold tokens. Each opponent creates a Gold token.

> A Vedalken operating a machine that produces gold tokens en masse. The tokens pile up, but their glow seems dimmer somehow. Inflation incoming.

## Design Notes
- Adds value counters to Gold (boosting assets)
- Creates Gold for everyone (money printing)
- Counter synergy: Value counters synergize with [[Hype Cycle]] and [[COMPOUND]]
- QE monetary policy reference
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Glimmervoid Rally (Gold Rally)]] - monetary policy
- Gold tokens synergize with [[🎲 GAMBLE]] rewards (Gamble creates Gold when you win)
- Pairs with: [[Inflation Harbinger]], [[Bailout Facilitator]], [[Market Crash]], [[Hedge Fund Manager]], [[Glimmervoid Broker]]
