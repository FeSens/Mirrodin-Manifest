# Unforged Witness

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Unforged

## Rules Text
> When Unforged Witness enters the battlefield, look at the top card of target opponent's library. You may reveal it. If a legendary card is revealed this way, that player discards a card.
>
> Sacrifice Unforged Witness: Reveal the top three cards of target opponent's library. Your opponents can't cast legendary spells until your next turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"They told me I was special. That I had potential. They were right—I was currency."*

## Image Prompt
> A young human figure with dimmed, flickering spark-light in their eyes, standing before a council of shadowy figures. They point an accusatory finger while holding a torn page from the Black Ledger. The council members recoil, their faces obscured but their ornate regalia visible. Pale whites and grays with flickers of dying golden light. MTG card art style, courtroom drama, tense atmosphere.

## Design Notes
- Reveals hidden information (exposing the powerful)
- Specifically targets legendary permanents (the elite)
- Sacrifice ability represents the danger of speaking out
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - Survivors of Ep-Styn's trafficking
- The Unforged creature type marks them as victims
