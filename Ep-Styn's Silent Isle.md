## Image Prompt
> A small, ominous island rising from the Quicksilver Sea at twilight. The liquid mercury waters reflect a sickly purple sky. At the island's center stands a temple-like structure of tarnished chrome and dark iron, with no windows—only a single dock where a Glimmer-Barge is moored, its hull empty. Strange lights flicker within the structure. The architecture is opulent but deeply wrong, with too many locked doors and winding passages visible in cross-section. Small figures (the Unforged) can be seen being led up the dock in a line. The whole scene is viewed from above, as if from a Blinkmoth's surveillance. Mirrodin metallic aesthetic, dark and unsettling, MTG card art style, ominous atmosphere, the horror hidden in plain sight.

## Design Notes
- **Lore connection:** [[Lore#The Great Ep-Styn Mystery]] - This is the Private Isle where Ep-Styn trafficked the Unforged
- Enters untapped for legendary creatures — the High Artificers, Synod officials, and Mer-Ikan elite always had easy access
- Creates Unforged tokens — the isle was the central hub of the Spark Trade; "can't block" represents their vulnerability and exploitation
- Sacrifice ability represents the blackmail and leverage gained from what happened on the isle
- The hand reveal mirrors the Black Ledger — seeing what others are hiding, then using it against them
- Mythic Rare because it's a central plot location and mechanically powerful
- **Synergy:** Works with [[Control The Narrative]] (protect your legendaries from the Unforged you create)
- **Synergy:** The Unforged tokens fuel sacrifice strategies and can be compounded for dark value
- **Flavor:** The Glimmer-Barges brought victims; the Ledger recorded the clients; the isle kept its silence
- Pairs thematically with: [[The Black Ledger]], [[Control The Narrative]], [[Unforged Witness]], [[Glimmer-Barge]]
