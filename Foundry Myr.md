# Foundry Myr

## Card Type Line
Artifact Creature — Myr

## Rules Text
> {T}: Add one mana of any color.

## Flavor Text
> *"Built to serve. Programmed to obey. Designed to never question."*

## Image Prompt
> A Myr working at the Great Furnace, molten metal channeling through its core.

## Design Notes
- Colorless common artifact creature - addresses Colorless common gap (-6)
- Mana fixing for limited
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]]
- Pairs with: [[Simulated Labor Myr]], [[Myr Replicant]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Key piece for [[Myr Galvanizer]] infinite mana combos; Works with [[Urza, Lord High Artificer]] for artifact synergy; [[Jhoira, Weatherlight Captain]] draws cards
- **POTENTIALLY BROKEN Combos:** [[Myr Galvanizer]] x2 + this = infinite mana of any color (tap for mana, untap with Galvanizer, repeat); [[Intruder Alarm]] + token producers = untap this repeatedly for mana; [[Pemmin's Aura]]/[[Freed from the Real]] + mana positive = infinite mana
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN - A 3-mana 2/2 Myr that taps for any color is very efficient and slots directly into known Myr infinite mana combos. Consider making it {4} like [[Alloy Myr]] or reducing stats to 1/1
