# Toxic Resurgence

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Return up to two target creature cards from your graveyard to your hand.
>
> You gain 2 life for each Zombie card returned this way.
>
> You may put a +1/+1 counter on target creature for each Elf card returned this way.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Dross and the Tangle share one truth: death is not the end."*

## Image Prompt
> Spirits rising from both the toxic swamps and the copper forest, life and death intertwined in the cycle.

## Design Notes
- **Graveyard bridge** - connects Dross AND Tangle themes
- Connects: [[Dross Harvester]], [[Mephidross Scavenger]], [[Tangle Ambusher]], [[Copper Myr Tender]], [[Natural Reclamation]]
- Rewards both Zombie and Elf tribal
- Counter synergy with [[Hype Cycle]]
- Golgari (B/G) - nature reclaims all
- Pairs with: [[Dross Dominion]], [[Tangle's Vengeance]], [[Soul Extraction]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Works with self-mill strategies using [[Grisly Salvage]], [[Satyr Wayfinder]], [[Stitcher's Supplier]]. Excellent with Elf/Zombie tribal commanders like [[Lathril, Blade of the Elves]] or [[Gisa and Geralf]]
- **Potential Combos:** Combine with [[Rot Hulk]] (return Zombie and gain life), or [[Elvish Archdruid]] for mana acceleration. [[Fierce Empath]] + this creates value loops
- **Balance Assessment:** Well-balanced uncommon. The tribal requirements balance the dual-mode value and prevent it from being too generically powerful
