## Priority 2: Card Type Balance

### Creature/Spell Ratio Issues
- **Overall Creature Ratio:** 72.1% (target: 55-70%) - slightly high
- **Common Creature Ratio:** 94.7% (target: 60-65%) - **critically high**

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Add common instants (2-3 per color minimum)
- [ ] Add common sorceries (1-2 per color)
- [ ] Add common enchantments/artifacts
- [ ] Ensure new common non-creatures cover removal needs:
  - White: Pacifism effects, conditional exile
  - Blue: Bounce, tap-down effects
  - Black: Destroy/kill spells, -X/-X
  - Red: Direct damage
  - Green: Fight effects, artifact/enchantment removal

### Current Type Distribution
- Creatures: 80 (72.1%)
- Enchantments: 9 (8.1%)
- Instants: 6 (5.4%)
- Artifacts: 6 (5.4%)
- Sorceries: 6 (5.4%)
- Lands: 2 (1.8%)

## Priority 3: Draft Archetype Support

### Signpost Uncommons Audit
The set has 10 multicolor uncommons. Verify each color pair has a signpost:

- [ ] WU (Azorius) - has cards, verify signpost
- [ ] UB (Dimir) - has Lattice Blackout, verify it's the signpost
- [ ] BR (Rakdos) - **check if exists**
- [ ] RG (Gruul) - **likely missing (no Green uncommons)**
- [ ] GW (Selesnya) - has Civilian Militia, verify as signpost
- [ ] WB (Orzhov) - has multiple cards, verify signpost
- [ ] UR (Izzet) - has Opposition Leader, verify as signpost
- [ ] BG (Golgari) - has Resistance Saboteur, verify as signpost
- [ ] RW (Boros) - **check if exists**
- [ ] GU (Simic) - **likely missing**

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Ensure each archetype has clear mechanical identity
- [ ] Each archetype should have 6+ support cards
- [ ] Verify signpost uncommons are powerful enough to first-pick

---

## Priority 4: Mana Fixing

- [ ] Design common dual lands (gain lands or similar cycle)
- [ ] Ensure 10 dual land cycle for all color pairs
- [ ] Consider mana rocks at common/uncommon

---

## Priority 5: Data Quality

- [ ] Find and fix 1 card missing CMC data
- [ ] Audit all cards for complete metadata:
  - CMC
  - Color
  - Rarity
  - Type
  - Power/Toughness (for creatures)

---

## Priority 6: New World Order Compliance

When designing new commons:
- [ ] Keep complexity low
- [ ] Minimize text
- [ ] Use familiar effects
- [ ] Include vanilla/french vanilla creatures
- [ ] Red-flag any complex commons for review
