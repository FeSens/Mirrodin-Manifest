# The House Edge

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> Whenever you would gamble, scry 1 first.

## Flavor Text
> *"The odds aren't in your favor. They're in mine. I built the table."*
> — Kha-Sino, Glimmervoid Broker

## Image Prompt
> A shadowy figure behind a chrome gambling table in a Glimmervoid casino, one hand subtly manipulating a deck of metallic cards while the other gestures welcomingly to unseen patrons. The table's surface shows faint reflection of the cards—the dealer can see everything. Myr croupiers stand motionless in the background. The lighting is warm gold from above but the dealer's face is in shadow, only a knowing smile visible. Opulent corruption, rigged elegance, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- **Mechanic synergy:** The GAMBLE mechanic notes explicitly state "Scry before Gamble is extremely strong" and "Knowledge (scry) = market manipulation"
- This card represents the casino always having an edge—you know what's coming
- At 2 mana, it's an early investment that pays off every gamble for the rest of the game
- Blue is the color of manipulation, information, and "cheating fair"
- The scry lets you either keep a high mana value card on top (to win) or bottom a low one (to improve odds)
- **Lore connection:** The Glimmervoid is home to the gold rally and high-stakes dealings; this is where the brokers rig the game
- Kha-Sino (casino) is a new character—a Glimmervoid dealer who runs crooked tables
- Pairs with: [[🎲 GAMBLE]], [[Gambling with the Devil]], [[Glimmervoid Broker]], [[Hedge Fund Manager]], [[The Rigged Game]]
- **Balance note:** Rare because it fundamentally changes the gamble dynamic; you're no longer gambling, you're just winning
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Glimmervoid Rally (Gold Rally)]] - rigged financial systems
