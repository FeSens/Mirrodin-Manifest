# Compute Debt

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> Whenever you cast an artifact spell, put a debt counter on Compute Debt.
>
> At the beginning of your upkeep, you may draw cards equal to the number of debt counters on Compute Debt. If you do, Compute Debt deals damage equal to the number of debt counters on it to you, then remove all debt counters from it.
>
> *"Spend now. Profit... eventually."*

## Flavor Text
> *The Lattice demanded infinite growth. The treasury had limits.*

## Image Prompt
> A massive chrome data center under construction, sprawling across the Mirrodin landscape. Vedalken accountants stand before holographic ledgers showing astronomical numbers in red. In the distance, more construction continues despite the mounting costs. Lightning crackles overhead—the power grid straining. The building is impressive but clearly unsustainable. Corporate hubris architecture, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Microsoft's $440B market cap loss; $7 trillion projected data center investment; OpenAI's $1.4T in commitments
- **Lore:** The unsustainable infrastructure spending on the En-Vidia Lattice
- Debt counters accumulate as you build your artifact empire
- The upkeep trigger: cash in your debt for cards (value) but take damage (the bill comes due)
- Risk/reward: let debt grow for bigger payoff, but bigger damage too
- Blue/Red for reckless innovation and "move fast and break things"
- [[Hype Cycle]] can double debt counters—accelerating both potential and danger
- Pairs with: [[Sal-Tman, Prophet of the Core-Logic]], [[Infrastructure Collapse]]
