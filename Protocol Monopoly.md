# Protocol Monopoly

## Card Type Line
Artifact

## Rules Text
> Whenever an artifact enters the battlefield under an opponent's control, you may pay {1}. If you do, draw a card.
>
> {T}: Add one mana of any color. Spend this mana only to cast artifact spells or activate abilities of artifacts.
>
> *"Open standard. Closed committee."*

## Flavor Text
> *The protocol was free. The foundation that controlled it was not.*

## Image Prompt
> A central hub where dozens of connection cables converge—Myr, constructs, and processing cores all plugged into a single chrome interface. The hub bears the symbol of a "neutral" foundation, but shadowy figures from different factions stand around it, clearly in control. The connections are standardized, but the power flows upward. Technical diagram aesthetic meets political intrigue, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Anthropic's MCP becoming industry standard; the Agentic AI Foundation
- **Lore:** The Manifest Connection Protocol—whoever controls the standard controls the connections
- You benefit whenever opponents play artifacts (everyone uses the protocol)
- The mana ability represents the protocol enabling artifact ecosystems
- "Open standard, closed committee" is the critique of corporate open-source
- Pairs with: [[The Orb-Seekers]], [[En-Vidia Processing Core]]
