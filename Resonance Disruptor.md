# Resonance Disruptor

## Card Type Line
Artifact

## Rules Text
> Resonance Disruptor enters the battlefield with two charge counters on it.
>
> {2}, {T}, Remove a charge counter from Resonance Disruptor: Resonance Disruptor deals 1 damage to each creature. Creatures dealt damage this way can't block this turn and their activated abilities can't be activated this turn.
>
> {T}, Sacrifice Resonance Disruptor: Resonance Disruptor deals damage equal to the number of charge counters on it to each creature. Tap all creatures dealt damage this way. They don't untap during their controller's next untap step.

## Flavor Text
> *"It was like my head was exploding from the inside. We all started bleeding. We fell to the ground, unable to move."*
> — Surviving guard, Fuerte Tiuna

## Image Prompt
> A strange Mer-Ikan military device mounted on a chrome tripod, emitting visible concentric sound waves that distort the air. Soldiers in the background clutch their heads, blood streaming from their noses and ears. The device has an industrial, weaponized look—all sharp angles and exposed En-Vidia processing cores. The scene is chaotic, lit by emergency red lights. Mirrodin chrome military aesthetic, brutal and clinical, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Reports of a "sonic weapon" used during Operation Absolute Resolve that allegedly left Venezuelan guards bleeding and vomiting
- **Counter synergy:** Charge counters fuel uses OR power up the sacrifice
- [[Hype Cycle]] doubles charges (2→4→8) for massive sacrifice damage
- [[Compound]] lets you build charge while using the small ability
- Choice: spend charges for control, or save them for the nuke
- **Quote is adapted from:** Venezuelan guard testimony reported by multiple outlets
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - military technology
- Pairs with: [[Foundry Strike Team]], [[Operation Absolute Resolve]], [[Terrified Survivor]]
