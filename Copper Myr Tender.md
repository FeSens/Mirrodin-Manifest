# Copper Myr Tender

## Card Type Line
Creature — Elf Druid

## Rules Text
> {T}: Add {G}.
>
> {T}: Untap target artifact creature you control. Activate only as a sorcery.

## Flavor Text
> *"Even the machines deserve compassion."*

## Image Prompt
> An Elf gently repairing a damaged Myr with organic copper fibers, the creature's eyes flickering back to life.

## Design Notes
- Green common creature - addresses Green common gap (-7)
- Mana dork with artifact creature synergy
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Tangle Resistance]]
- Pairs with: [[Simulated Labor Myr]], [[Myr Replicant]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Myr Galvanizer]] untaps all Myr including this; [[Palladium Myr]] mana Myr synergy; [[Steel Overseer]] puts counters on artifact creatures
- **Potential Combos:** [[Clock of Omens]] tap artifacts to untap this repeatedly; [[Voltaic Key]] untap artifact creatures for more mana; [[Dramatic Reversal]] + [[Isochron Scepter]] infinite mana with mana dorks
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - The untap ability being sorcery-speed prevents most infinite combos. Solid mana dork with artifact synergy but not broken
