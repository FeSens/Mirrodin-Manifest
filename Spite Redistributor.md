# Spite Redistributor

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Cleric

## Rules Text
> Whenever you redistribute, you may have target opponent lose 2 life.
>
> {1}{B}, {T}: Redistribute. *(Choose two permanents. Remove all counters from them, then each gets half that many counters, rounded down.)*

## Flavor Text
> *"Equality hurts. That's the point."*

## Image Prompt
> A malicious cleric in black robes, taking counters from one pile and distributing them while draining life from onlookers. Cruel equality.

## Design Notes
- Black uncommon creature - addresses Black uncommon gap (-10)
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] synergy - Black weaponizes redistribution
- Activated ability enables redistribution on demand
- Life drain on each redistribute adds Black's angle
- Pairs with [[Counter Vulture]], [[Central Planner]], [[Mak-Ron, the Glass Orator]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Blood Artist]]/[[Zulaport Cutthroat]] life drain synergies stack; [[Hardened Scales]] adds counters after redistribution; [[Animation Module]] generates servos when counters are placed
- **Potential Combos:** With multiple redistribute effects per turn, drain life repeatedly; [[Strionic Resonator]] copies the life loss trigger; Against +1/+1 counter decks - repeatedly redistribute their counters while draining
- **Balance Assessment:** Balanced - 3 mana 2/3, requires tap to activate, only drains 2 life
