Legendary Creature — Leonin Soldier

## Rules Text

>

>
> {G}{W}, Remove a resistance counter from Zel-Ensk: Create a 1/1 white Soldier creature token with vigilance.

## Flavor Text
> *"While he stands, the resistance stands."*

## Image Prompt
> A battle-scarred Leonin in practical armor standing defiantly on a watchtower, surrounded by loyal soldiers. Equipment adorns every surface. The Vault of Whispers burns in the distance. Defiant hope.

## Design Notes
- Zel-Ensk from [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - Zelensky allegory
- Indestructible = resilience
- Counter synergy: Resistance counters create soldiers, [[Hype Cycle]] doubles, [[COMPOUND]] adds
- Equipment synergy references his famous quote
- Pairs with: [[Put-In, the Iron Despot]], [[Watchtower Defender]], [[Foreign Arms Supplier]], [[Civilian Militia]]
