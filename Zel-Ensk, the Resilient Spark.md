# Zel-Ensk, the Resilient Spark

## Card Type Line
Legendary Creature — Leonin Soldier

## Rules Text
> Vigilance, indestructible
>
> Zel-Ensk, the Resilient Spark enters the battlefield with three resistance counters on it.
>
> Equipment attached to Zel-Ensk cost {0} to equip.
>
> {G}{W}, Remove a resistance counter from Zel-Ensk: Create a 1/1 white Soldier creature token with vigilance.
>
> *"I don't need transport. I need Equipment."*

## Flavor Text
> *"While he stands, the resistance stands."*

## Image Prompt
> A battle-scarred Leonin in practical armor standing defiantly on a watchtower, surrounded by loyal soldiers. Equipment adorns every surface. The Vault of Whispers burns in the distance. Defiant hope.

## Design Notes
- Zel-Ensk from [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - Zelensky allegory
- Indestructible = resilience
- Counter synergy: Resistance counters create soldiers, [[Hype Cycle]] doubles, [[COMPOUND]] adds
- Equipment synergy references his famous quote
- Pairs with: [[Put-In, the Iron Despot]], [[Watchtower Defender]], [[Foreign Arms Supplier]], [[Civilian Militia]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Puresteel Paladin]] free equips (redundant but card draw), [[Hammer of Nazahn]] equipment enter attached, [[Sword cycle]] for protection/value
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Colossus Hammer]] equips for free = 13/14 indestructible vigilance; [[Worldslayer]] equips for free, attack to destroy all other permanents (Zel-Ensk survives due to indestructible)
- **Balance Assessment:** VERY POWERFUL - Free equip on indestructible creature enables broken equipment synergies. Colossus Hammer makes a 13/14 that can't be destroyed. Worldslayer creates one-sided Armageddon. Consider adding "nonlegendary Equipment" or mana cost to equip activation
