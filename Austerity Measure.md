# Austerity Measure

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Redistribute among target [[Debt Token|Debt token]] and target permanent with counters.

## Flavor Text
> *"Cuts must be made somewhere."*

## Image Prompt
> A stern bureaucrat in white robes slicing through a budget document, counters flying from one pile to another. Behind them, both wealthy and poor permanents are affected equally. Cold, indifferent efficiency, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- White common instant
- Cheap redistribute trick at {W}
- Can move counters between Debt and +1/+1 counters on creatures
- Instant speed for surprise plays
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] common access
- Pairs with: [[Debt Restructuring]], [[Central Bank Governor]]
