# Gilded Sentinel's Decree

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Choose one or both —
>
> • Exile all creatures that weren't cast from their owner's hand.
>
> • Until your next turn, players can't cast spells with mana value greater than the number of lands they control.

## Flavor Text
> *"The unrefined have no place within these walls. The overleveraged have no voice within this chamber."*
> — Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel

## Image Prompt
> Tromp the Loxodon standing on a balcony of the Great Furnace, arms raised, emanating a blinding golden decree that ripples outward. Below, creatures without proper documentation dissolve into light while others cower. The Darksteel Wall looms in the background. Brilliant golds, whites, and burnished bronze. MTG card art style, authoritarian grandeur, propaganda poster aesthetic.

## Design Notes
- First mode: Mass exile for tokens/reanimated/cheated creatures (deportation)
- Second mode: Mana value restriction (interest cap / anti-leverage)
- "Choose one or both" gives flexibility
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - Tromp's signature policy card
- White's "law and order" taken to authoritarian extreme
- Pairs with: [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[The Darksteel Wall]], [[Foundry Border Commander]]
