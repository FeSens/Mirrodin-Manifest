# Archive Scrubbing

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Choose one —
>
> • Counter target spell if it has the same name as a card in any graveyard.
>
> • Exile up to three target cards from graveyards. If a legendary card was exiled this way, scry 2.
>
> *The Redaction-Myr never rest.*

## Flavor Text
> *"What records? There were never any records."*
> — Synod Archivist

## Image Prompt
> A Redaction-Myr hunched over ancient chrome tablets, methodically scratching names from the surface with ink-stained fingers. The scratched-out sections still faintly glow with the ghost of what was written. Other Myr carry tablets away to be melted in the background. Blues, silvers, and faded ghostly text remnants. MTG card art style, bureaucratic horror, Orwellian atmosphere.

## Design Notes
- Graveyard hate with flexibility
- Counters "repeat offenses" (spells cast from graveyard or copies)
- Specifically rewards exiling legendary cards (the important names)
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - The Redaction-Myr scrubbing Ep-Styn's records
- Blue's manipulation of information
