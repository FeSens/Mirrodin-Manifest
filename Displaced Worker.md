# Displaced Worker

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human

## Rules Text
> When Displaced Worker enters the battlefield, if an opponent controls more artifacts than you, create a 0/1 colorless Myr artifact creature token.
>
> Sacrifice an artifact: Displaced Worker gets +2/+0 until end of turn.
>
> *"They said the Myr would free us. They meant free us from employment."*

## Power/Toughness
> 2/2

## Flavor Text
> *Forty years at the forge. Replaced by something that doesn't even have hands.*

## Image Prompt
> A tired human worker standing outside a chrome factory, holding a termination notice. Through the window behind them, tiny Myr inefficiently attempt to do the work they once did. The worker's expression is a mix of anger and resignation. Other displaced workers gather nearby, some organizing, some simply lost. Industrial Mirrodin backdrop, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** The 50,000+ workers laid off with AI cited as the reason; the "AI-washing" phenomenon
- **Lore:** Beings across Mirrodin displaced by supposed automation
- ETB creates a Myr if opponent has more artifacts—you get your "replacement"
- Sacrifice artifact for power boost represents rage against the machines
- White for the working class, community, and displaced labor
- Common because this is happening everywhere
- Pairs with: [[Optimization Lie]], [[Trough of Disillusionment]]
