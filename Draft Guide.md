# Mirrodin Manifest - Draft Guide

*A comprehensive guide for drafting in the corporate dystopia of Mirrodin.*

---

## Quick Reference

| Mechanic | What It Does | Best Colors |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **GAMBLE** | Compare top cards—higher MV wins | Red, Green, Blue |
| **COMPOUND** | Add a counter to a permanent that already has one | Blue, Black, Green |
| **REDISTRIBUTE** | Split counters between two permanents (rounded down) | White, Blue, Black |

---

## The Three Core Mechanics

### GAMBLE

> *To gamble, you and target opponent reveal the top card of your libraries. Whoever reveals the card with greater mana value wins.*

**How to Draft Around Gamble:**
- **Higher curve = more wins.** If your deck has many 4-5 drops, you'll win gambles more often.
- **Scry is premium.** Cards like [[Processing Queue]] and [[Lattice Analyst]] let you set up your top card before gambling.
- **Read the payoffs.** Some gamble cards are great when you win, mediocre when you lose. Others punish you hard for losing.

**Key Gamble Cards by Rarity:**

| Rarity | Card | Why It's Good |
|--------|------|---------------|
| Common | [[Furnace Bolt]] | Removal that can hit harder if you win |
| Common | [[Gamble with Fate]] | Card selection with upside |
| Uncommon | [[Glimmervoid High Roller]] | Repeatable gamble triggers |
| Uncommon | [[Sylvok Chance-Shaper]] | Manipulate the gamble outcome |
| Rare | [[Kha-Sino, Fortune's Dealer]] | Build-around gamble payoff |

**Draft Tip:** In aggressive decks, don't worry about winning every gamble—the floor on most gamble cards is still playable. In slower decks, prioritize scry effects to rig the game.

### COMPOUND

> *To compound, choose a permanent and add a counter to it of a type already on it.*

**How to Draft Around Compound:**
- **Get counters on the board first.** Compound does nothing without existing counters.
- **+1/+1 counters are the most common.** Green creatures often enter with them.
- **Watch for Debt tokens.** Compounding your opponent's Debt tokens increases their life loss!
- **Gold tokens scale.** Compounding a Gold token's value counter makes it tap for more mana.

**Key Compound Cards by Rarity:**

| Rarity | Card | Why It's Good |
|--------|------|---------------|
| Common | [[Opportunistic Growth]] | Cheap way to start the counter engine |
| Common | [[Copper Myr Tender]] | Mana dork that compounds |
| Uncommon | [[Lattice Overseer]] | Repeatable compound on artifacts |
| Uncommon | [[Grove Multiplier]] | ETB compound with a body |
| Rare | [[Recursive Self-Improvement]] | Exponential growth enchantment |

**Draft Tip:** Compound is strongest in UG and BG where you can combine counter generation with compound triggers. A single creature with 3-4 +1/+1 counters becomes a massive threat.

---

### REDISTRIBUTE

> *To redistribute, choose two permanents. Remove all counters from them, then each gets half that many counters, rounded down.*

**How to Draft Around Redistribute:**
- **Net counter loss.** 7 + 1 = 8 total, but after redistribute each gets 4. You always lose counters to rounding.
- **Weaponize it.** Target an opponent's creature with 6 counters and your creature with 0. Now they each have 3.
- **Spread -1/-1 counters.** Put -1/-1 counters on one creature, then redistribute to weaken two creatures.
- **Answers big threats.** A creature that grew to 10/10 with counters? Redistribute brings it back to earth.

**Key Redistribute Cards by Rarity:**

| Rarity | Card | Why It's Good |
|--------|------|---------------|
| Common | [[Equitable Distribution]] | Sorcery-speed redistribution |
| Common | [[Volatile Equalization]] | Redistribute + damage |
| Common | [[Memory Normalization]] | Instant speed with Scry 1 |
| Uncommon | [[Central Planner]] | Automatic redistribution each upkeep |
| Rare | [[The Great Leveling]] | Mass redistribution effect |

**Draft Tip:** Redistribute is excellent sideboard tech against Compound decks. Main deck it if you're in White or if you see lots of counter-based threats in the draft.

|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **WU** | Control/Redistribute | Counter manipulation, tap effects, fly over |
| **UB** | Compound/Secrets | Grow threats, exploit Debt tokens, card advantage |

## Draft Priorities by Color

### White

**Role:** Controlling, defensive, forced equality

**Premium Commons:**
- [[Citizen's Arrest]] - Removal
- [[Equitable Distribution]] - Counter manipulation
- [[Foundry Medic]] - Life gain + counters
- [[Sanctuary Guardian]] - Efficient blocker

**What White Wants:** Ways to stabilize, then either fly over or grind out with redistribution. White pairs well with Blue for control or Black for aristocrats.

---

### Blue

**Role:** Card selection, counter manipulation, Myr tribal

**Premium Commons:**
- [[Memory Normalization]] - Instant speed redistribute + scry
- [[Processing Queue]] - Card filtering
- [[Lattice Analyst]] - Scry on ETB
- [[Processing Myr]] - Artifact synergy

**What Blue Wants:** Set up your draws, compound counters on key permanents, and outvalue opponents. Blue is the best support color in the format.

---

### Black

**Role:** Debt creation, sacrifice, recursion

**Premium Commons:**
- [[Spite Tax]] - Debt manipulation + life drain
- [[Dross Harvester]] - Sacrifice payoff
- [[Mephidross Scavenger]] - Recursion
- [[Soul Extraction]] - Removal

**What Black Wants:** Create Debt tokens for opponents, sacrifice your own stuff for value, and recur threats. Black loves long games where Debt accumulates.

---

### Red

**Role:** Aggression, gamble payoffs, artifact destruction

**Premium Commons:**
- [[Furnace Bolt]] - Flexible removal
- [[Furnace Stoker]] - Aggressive 2-drop
- [[Volatile Equalization]] - Redistribute + damage
- [[Reckless Gambit]] - Card filtering with gamble

**What Red Wants:** Pressure opponents early, use gamble cards for reach, destroy key artifacts. Red is the best aggressive color but can pivot to midrange with Green.

---

### Green

**Role:** +1/+1 counters, ramp, natural growth

**Premium Commons:**
- [[Tangle's Fury]] - Fight spell (creature removal!)
- [[Opportunistic Growth]] - Counter generation
- [[Tangle Equilibrium]] - Friendly redistribute
- [[Tangle Hunter]] - Efficient creature

**What Green Wants:** Land creatures with +1/+1 counters, compound them, attack with huge threats. Green has the best creature quality but needs support for removal.

---

## Key Tokens

### Debt Tokens

**What they do:** Enter with a debt counter. At the beginning of your upkeep, you lose life equal to debt counters on it, then sacrifice it.

**Strategy:**
- Give them to opponents via cards like [[Predatory Lending]]
- Compound your opponent's Debt tokens to increase damage
- Sacrifice your own Debt tokens before upkeep to avoid life loss
- [[Spite Tax]] can redistribute debt counters between tokens

### Gold Tokens

**What they do:** Enter with a value counter. Sacrifice to add {C} for each value counter on it.

**Strategy:**
- Compound Gold tokens to increase their mana output
- Unlike Treasure, Gold has variable value—protect high-value Gold
- Use for big mana turns or as sacrifice fodder

### Myr Tokens

**What they do:** 1/1 colorless artifact creatures

**Strategy:**
- Go wide with Myr tribal cards
- Sacrifice for value in BR
- Blue has the most Myr synergies

## Mana Fixing

### Processing Gate Cycle (Common Duals)

All five allied-color pairs have a common dual land:

| Land | Colors |
|------|--------|
| [[Synod Processing Gate]] | WU |
| [[Vault Processing Gate]] | UB |
| [[Furnace Processing Gate]] | BR |
| [[Oxidda Processing Gate]] | RG |
| [[Tangle Processing Gate]] | GW |

**Features:** Enter tapped, Scry 1, tap for either color

**Draft Tip:** Take these early if you're committing to two colors. The Scry 1 is real value, especially for Gamble decks.

---

## Removal Checklist

Always know what removal exists at common/uncommon:

| Color | Card | What It Hits |
|-------|------|--------------|
| White | [[Citizen's Arrest]] | Any creature (exile) |
| White | [[Protective Ward]] | Damage prevention |
| Blue | [[Freeze Protocol]] | Tap + doesn't untap |
| Blue | [[Synod's Rejection]] | Bounce + counter if mana paid |
| Black | [[Soul Extraction]] | Destroy creature |
| Black | [[Dross Executioner]] | -X/-X effect |
| Red | [[Furnace Bolt]] | Damage-based |
| Red | [[Volatile Reaction]] | Artifact/creature damage |
| Green | [[Tangle's Fury]] | Fight spell |
| Green | [[Nature's Rebalancing]] | Redistribute counters (soft removal) |

---

## Bomb Rares to Watch For

These cards can take over a game—prioritize removal or be ready to lose:

| Card | Why It's Scary |
|------|----------------|
| [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]] | Creates Gold tokens, protects your board |
| [[Sal-Tman, Prophet of the Core-Logic]] | Token generation + scry engine |
| [[Put-In, the Iron Despot]] | Recursive Nim army |
| [[Zel-Ensk, the Resilient Spark]] | Indestructible threat with counter synergy |
| [[The Great Furnace Awakened]] | Land that becomes a huge creature |
| [[Mad-Uro, the Hollow Throne]] | Scaling threat that drains life |

## Common Draft Mistakes

1. **Drafting Gamble without payoffs.** Gamble cards that do nothing when you lose are traps.

2. **No counter sources for Compound.** Compound does literally nothing without counters already on the board.

3. **Ignoring Debt tokens.** If you're creating Debt for yourself, have a sacrifice plan.

4. **Over-drafting Redistribute.** It's situational—2-3 redistribute effects is usually enough.

5. **Forgetting artifact synergies.** This is Mirrodin—artifacts matter. Even if you're not UR, artifact creatures and Gold/Debt tokens create synergies.

6. **Not respecting aggro.** RW and BR can kill you fast. Have early plays.

---

## Sample Draft Picks (Pack 1, Pick 1)

**Clear First Picks:**
- Any rare bomb (Tromp, Sal-Tman, etc.)
- Premium removal ([[Soul Extraction]], [[Citizen's Arrest]])
- Efficient threats ([[Glimmervoid High Roller]], [[Tangle Titan]])

**Strong Picks:**
- Mana fixing (Processing Gates)
- Build-around uncommons
- Premium commons in open colors

**Avoid Early:**
- Narrow sideboard cards
- Cards that require specific synergies without payoffs
- High-MV cards without impact

---

## Final Tips

1. **Stay open Pack 1.** The mechanics reward synergy, but don't force an archetype too early.

2. **Prioritize removal.** There are limited ways to deal with a compounded 8/8.

3. **Count your curve.** Gamble rewards higher-MV cards, but you still need early plays.

4. **Read the signals.** If Redistribute cards are wheeling, White is open.

5. **Have a plan for Debt.** Either give it to opponents or sacrifice your own.

6. **Scry is better than it looks.** Setting up gambles or finding key cards is huge.
