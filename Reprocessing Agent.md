# Reprocessing Agent

## Card Type Line
Creature — Golem Mer-Ikan

## Rules Text
> When Reprocessing Agent enters the battlefield, exile target creature an opponent controls with mana value 3 or less until Reprocessing Agent leaves the battlefield.
>
> *Foundry Protocol* — Reprocessing Agent can't be blocked by creatures that weren't cast from their owner's hand.

## Flavor Text
> *"Documentation, please. No? Then you're scheduled for extraction."*

## Image Prompt
> A imposing chrome golem in militaristic armor standing at a checkpoint made of darksteel barriers. It holds a glowing scanner in one hand, the other hand transformed into restraining clamps. Behind it, a long line of frightened creatures wait to be processed. The Great Furnace glows ominously in the background. Stark white and silver color palette with harsh industrial lighting. MTG card art style, authoritarian atmosphere, Mirrodin aesthetic.

## Design Notes
- Mechanic: Temporary exile (like Banisher Priest)
- The "Foundry Protocol" ability represents how undocumented creatures can't interfere
- Creature type Mer-Ikan establishes the faction
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - The Mer-Ikan Foundry's enforcement arm
- White fits the "law and order" flavor, even when unjust
