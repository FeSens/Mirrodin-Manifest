# Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel

## Card Type Line
Legendary Creature — Loxodon Artificer

## Rules Text
> Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel enters the battlefield with three construction counters on it.
>
> Creatures that weren't cast from their owner's hand can't attack you or planeswalkers you control.
>
> At the beginning of your upkeep, put a construction counter on Tromp. Then Tromp deals damage equal to the number of construction counters on it to each creature that wasn't cast from its owner's hand.
>
> *"Make the Core Solid Again."*

## Flavor Text
> *"The unrefined have no place within these walls."*

## Image Prompt
> A massive Loxodon in gilded armor standing atop a wall under construction, gesturing grandly. His trunk is adorned with gold rings, his eyes gleam with self-satisfaction. The Great Furnace blazes behind him. Authoritarian grandeur.

## Design Notes
- Tromp from [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - Trump allegory
- Construction counters grow (wall gets bigger)
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles counters = massive damage, [[COMPOUND]] accelerates
- Anti-token, anti-reanimate hosing
- Pairs with: [[The Darksteel Wall]], [[Gilded Sentinel's Decree]], [[Foundry Border Commander]], [[Reprocessing Agent]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Proliferate effects]] accelerate counter growth; [[Propaganda]]/[[Ghostly Prison]] combined with "can't attack" clause creates soft lock
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Doubling Season]]/[[Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider]] enters with 6 counters, deals 6 damage immediately, doubles each turn; [[Paradox Haze]] double upkeep = double counter growth and double damage
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN - Exponential scaling damage completely shuts down token and reanimator strategies. With counter doublers, deals 6→14→30 damage per turn. Consider capping damage or adding "nontoken" restriction
