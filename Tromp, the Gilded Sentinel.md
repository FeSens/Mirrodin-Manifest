# Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel

## Card Type Line
Legendary Creature — Loxodon Artificer

## Rules Text
> Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel enters the battlefield with three construction counters on it.
>
> Creatures that weren't cast from their owner's hand can't attack you or planeswalkers you control.
>
> At the beginning of your upkeep, put a construction counter on Tromp. Then Tromp deals damage equal to the number of construction counters on it to each creature that wasn't cast from its owner's hand.
>
> *"Make the Core Solid Again."*

## Flavor Text
> *"The unrefined have no place within these walls."*

## Image Prompt
> A massive Loxodon in gilded armor standing atop a wall under construction, gesturing grandly. His trunk is adorned with gold rings, his eyes gleam with self-satisfaction. The Great Furnace blazes behind him. Authoritarian grandeur.

## Design Notes
- Tromp from [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - Trump allegory
- Construction counters grow (wall gets bigger)
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles counters = massive damage, [[COMPOUND]] accelerates
- Anti-token, anti-reanimate hosing
- Pairs with: [[The Darksteel Wall]], [[Gilded Sentinel's Decree]], [[Foundry Border Commander]], [[Reprocessing Agent]]
