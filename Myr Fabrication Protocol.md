# Myr Fabrication Protocol

## Card Type Line
Artifact

## Rules Text
> Myr creatures you control enter the battlefield with an additional +1/+1 counter on them.
>
> Whenever a Myr creature you control dies, you may pay {2}. If you do, create a 1/1 colorless Myr artifact creature token.
>
> {4}, {T}: Create a 1/1 colorless Myr artifact creature token with a replication counter on it.

## Flavor Text
> *"Efficiency protocol: Replace. Improve. Repeat."*

## Image Prompt
> A gleaming Myr fabrication facility, assembly lines producing identical Myr units. Each emerges slightly improved from the last. The factory never stops.

## Design Notes
- **Myr tribal hub** - buffs and replaces Myr
- Connects: [[Myr Replicant]], [[Simulated Labor Myr]], [[Myr-Sourced Automation]], [[The Great Optimization]]
- Replication counter synergy with [[Hype Cycle]]
- Counter synergy (+1/+1 counters on Myr)
- Pairs with [[Recursive Self-Improvement]], [[En-Vidia Processing Core]]
- Automation theme: the machines build more machines
- Death trigger represents efficiency - nothing is wasted

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Myr Galvanizer]] untaps all Myr, infinite combo potential; [[Myr Battlesphere]] creates 4 Myr tokens all entering with counters; [[Hardened Scales]] extra +1/+1 counters on Myr
- **POTENTIALLY BROKEN Combos:** [[Myr Galvanizer]] x2 + any mana Myr = infinite mana (all Myr now enter bigger); [[Ashnod's Altar]] sacrifice Myr for 2 mana, pay 2 to make new one = mana neutral loop; [[Phyrexian Altar]] sacrifice for colored mana, create replacements
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN - The death trigger creating replacements combined with the +1/+1 counter entry effect creates strong value loops. With Ashnod's Altar or Phyrexian Altar, this goes infinite with enough Myr. Consider adding "once per turn" to the death trigger or increasing the replacement cost
