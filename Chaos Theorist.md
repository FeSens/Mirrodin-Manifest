## Design Notes
- Red uncommon creature - addresses Red uncommon gap (-10)
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] synergy - enables and rewards gambling
- "Whenever you gamble" is a new trigger type for the set
- Activated ability lets you gamble at will
- Pairs with [[Profit Taker]], [[Opportunistic Growth]], [[The House Edge]]
- Damage happens win or lose - pure chaos value

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Krark's Thumb]] improves gamble odds while dealing 1 damage per gamble regardless; [[Chance Encounter]] adds luck counters per gamble; [[Dictate of the Twin Gods]]/[[Fiery Emancipation]] damage multipliers
- **Potential Combos:** [[Intruder Alarm]] + token generators - untap, gamble, deal damage repeatedly; [[Thousand-Year Storm]] + instants - each spell triggers multiple coin flips from Krark, the Thumbless; In multiplayer with multiple opponents, 1 damage to each adds up
- **Balance Assessment:** Balanced - 2 mana 2/2, damage happens win or lose (only 1 though), requires tap
