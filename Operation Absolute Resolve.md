## Flavor Text
> *The Foundry doesn't negotiate. It resolves.*

## Image Prompt
> A massive aerial assault on a fortified chrome compound at night. Mer-Ikan aircraft rain fire on defensive structures while elite soldiers in heavy powered armor fast-rope from hovering thopters. Explosions light up the Mirrodin sky in orange and white. The compound's defenses crumble. In the center, a terrified figure in ornate robes is being dragged from a building by armored soldiers. The scene is chaos and precision combined—surgical destruction. MTG card art style, military action, dramatic lighting.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Operation Absolute Resolve, January 3, 2026 — the U.S. Delta Force raid that captured Maduro
- **Lore adaptation:** A Mer-Ikan Foundry decapitation strike against a rival power
- "Can't be countered" represents the overwhelming force and surprise
- Destroying artifacts represents the bombing of infrastructure and air defenses
- Exiling the legendary creature and being able to cast it represents "capturing" the leader and using them (extradition, trial, leverage)
- The mana cost is significant but the effect is game-changing
- **Timeline reference:** Delta Force reached Maduro in 3 minutes, had him in custody in 5
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - military operations
- Pairs with: [[Foundry Strike Team]], [[Resonance Disruptor]], [[Lattice Blackout]], [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]]
