# Trough of Disillusionment

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> Artifact creatures enter the battlefield tapped and don't untap during their controllers' untap steps.
>
> At the beginning of each player's upkeep, that player may pay {2}. If they do, untap all artifact creatures they control.
>
> *"It works. Just not as well as they promised."*

## Flavor Text
> *The Myr still function. They just don't perform miracles.*

## Image Prompt
> A once-gleaming En-Vidia Processing Core now sitting dormant, covered in a thin layer of dust. Vedalken technicians stand around it, arms crossed, expressions disappointed. Charts on the walls show declining performance curves. The room's lighting is dim—power has been diverted elsewhere. Other Myr stand motionless in the background, awaiting commands that don't come. The aftermath of hype, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Gartner's Hype Cycle - GenAI entering the Trough of Disillusionment in 2025
- **Lore:** The moment Mirrodin realizes the En-Vidia Lattice isn't delivering
- Artifact creatures still work, but require ongoing investment (pay {2}) to function
- Symmetrical effect—everyone's AI dreams are deflated
- Blue/Black for broken promises and institutional disillusionment
- The pay-to-untap represents "it works, but costs more than advertised"
- Pairs with: [[Hype Cycle]], [[Sal-Tman's Promise]], [[The Vibe Shift]]
