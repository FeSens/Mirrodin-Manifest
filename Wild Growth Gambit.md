# Wild Growth Gambit

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Gamble. If you win the gamble, search your library for a basic land card, put it onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle. If you lose, search your library for a basic land card, put it into your hand, then shuffle.

## Flavor Text
> *"Nature rewards the bold. Or at least, the lucky."*

## Image Prompt
> A Sylvok druid holding glowing seeds, some sprouting into massive trees, others wilting. The Tangle's growth is unpredictable.

## Design Notes
- Green common sorcery - addresses Green common gap (-16)
- Addresses common creature ratio issue
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] synergy - Green gets gamble too!
- Win = ramp (land to battlefield), Lose = still get land to hand
- Floor is still useful, ceiling is powerful for common
- Pairs with [[The House Edge]] for guaranteed ramp

## Cross-Format Interactions
| External Card | Interaction |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Krark's Thumb** | Improves gamble odds significantly |
| **Library Manipulation** (Worldly Tutor, Sylvan Library) | Stack high CMC on top to win |
| **Landfall Triggers** (Lotus Cobra, Omnath) | Win = immediate landfall trigger |
| **Amulet of Vigor** | Land enters untapped on win = immediate mana |
| **Tireless Provisioner** | Creates Food/Treasure on landfall |
| **Crucible of Worlds** | Can replay lands if game goes long |
| **High CMC Deck Building** | Decks with expensive cards naturally win more gambles |

**Format Assessment:**
- **Commander**: Excellent - floor is Lay of the Land, ceiling is Rampant Growth
- **Modern/Legacy**: Compares favorably to other 2-mana ramp with upside variance
- **Limited**: Premium common - ramp is always valuable, and floor is still playable
