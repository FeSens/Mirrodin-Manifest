# Myr Replicant

## Card Type Line
Artifact Creature — Myr

## Rules Text
> When Myr Replicant enters the battlefield, put a replication counter on it.
>
> {3}, Remove a replication counter from Myr Replicant: Create a token that's a copy of Myr Replicant.

## Flavor Text
> *"One becomes two. Two becomes enough."*

## Image Prompt
> A small chrome Myr standing next to an identical copy of itself. Both have glowing blue eyes and smooth, rounded bodies. A third partially-formed Myr emerges from a fabrication pod behind them. Assembly line aesthetic.

## Design Notes
- Self-replicating Myr for the AI/automation theme
- Counter synergy: Replication counters doubled by [[Hype Cycle]] → exponential growth, [[COMPOUND]] adds fuel
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]] - Myr automation
- Pairs with: [[Myr-Sourced Automation]], [[Simulated Labor Myr]], [[Recursive Self-Improvement]]
