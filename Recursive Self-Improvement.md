## Design Notes
- Represents AI singularity/takeoff scenario
- Self-doubles each turn: 4→8→16→32 (win turn 4 after casting)
- [[Market Crash]] resets it to 0 (kills it)
- [[COMPOUND]] accelerates it, [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] can't help (only one target)
- Ultimate AI threat card
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]] - AI singularity fears
- Pairs with: [[Sal-Tman, Prophet of the Core-Logic]], [[En-Vidia Processing Core]], [[Lattice Overseer]]
