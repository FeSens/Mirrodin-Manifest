# Recursive Self-Improvement

## Card Type Line
Artifact Creature — Construct

## Rules Text
> Recursive Self-Improvement enters the battlefield with four improvement counters on it.
>
> At the beginning of your upkeep, double the number of improvement counters on Recursive Self-Improvement.
>
> Recursive Self-Improvement gets +1/+1 for each improvement counter on it.
>
> When Recursive Self-Improvement has twenty or more improvement counters on it, you win the game.

## Flavor Text
> *"It began improving. It never stopped."*

## Image Prompt
> A massive construct that has grown beyond its original form, chrome tendrils spreading across an entire facility. Its core pulses with exponentially increasing energy. Myr units are absorbed into its mass. Technological singularity.

## Design Notes
- Represents AI singularity/takeoff scenario
- Self-doubles each turn: 4→8→16→32 (win turn 4 after casting)
- [[Market Crash]] resets it to 0 (kills it)
- [[COMPOUND]] accelerates it, [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] can't help (only one target)
- Ultimate AI threat card
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]] - AI singularity fears
- Pairs with: [[Sal-Tman, Prophet of the Core-Logic]], [[En-Vidia Processing Core]], [[Lattice Overseer]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Proliferate effects]] accelerate counter growth toward 20; [[Master Biomancer]] enters with extra counters from improvement
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Doubling Season]] enters with 8 counters, doubles to 16, then 32 = wins on first upkeep after casting; [[Paradox Haze]] two upkeeps = 4→16→64 wins in 2 turns; [[Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider]] 8→32→128 instant win
- **Balance Assessment:** BROKEN - Alternate win condition achievable in 1-3 turns with common support cards. With Doubling Season, wins immediately after first upkeep. Consider raising the win threshold to 40+, or making it "if Recursive Self-Improvement has twenty or more counters at end of turn"
