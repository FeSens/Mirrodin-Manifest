# Infrastructure Collapse

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Destroy all artifacts. For each artifact destroyed this way, its controller creates a [[Debt Token|Debt token]].

## Flavor Text
> *"The bill for progress came due all at once."*

## Image Prompt
> The En-Vidia Lattice collapsing in a massive explosion, data centers crumbling, processing cores shattering. In the foreground, accountants frantically calculate the mounting debt as the sky fills with red warning runes. Catastrophic infrastructure failure, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- Red rare artifact sweeper
- Mass artifact destruction + mass debt creation
- [[Lore]] connection: En-Vidia Lattice collapse
- Symmetrical but can be built around
- Devastating in artifact-heavy metagames
- Pairs with: [[Compute Debt]], [[Trough of Disillusionment]]
