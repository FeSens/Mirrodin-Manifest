# Jackpot Wurm

## Card Type Line
Creature — Wurm

## Rules Text
> Trample
>
> When Jackpot Wurm enters the battlefield, gamble three times. For each gamble you win, put three +1/+1 counters on Jackpot Wurm.

## Flavor Text
> *"It feeds on luck itself."*

## Image Prompt
> A massive wurm bursting from the ground in a Glimmervoid casino, gold tokens cascading off its scales. Triple sevens glow on its hide.

## Design Notes
- Green rare creature - addresses Green rare gap (-10, critical!)
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] synergy - multiple gambles for massive upside
- Floor: 6/6 trample for 6 (fair)
- Ceiling: 6/6 + 9 counters = 15/15 trample (insane)
- Average: ~1.5 wins = 6/6 + 4-5 counters
- Pairs with [[The House Edge]], [[Sylvok Chance-Shaper]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Krark's Thumb]] average of 2.25 wins out of 3 = 6-9 counters typically (12/12-15/15 wurm); [[Hardened Scales]]/[[Corpsejack Menace]] doubles counter placement (3 wins = 18 counters!); [[Panharmonicon]] doubles the ETB trigger for 6 total gambles
- **Potential Combos:** [[Krark's Thumb]] + [[Doubling Season]] could enter as a 30/30+ trample creature; [[Strionic Resonator]] copies the ETB for 6 gambles total; [[Rite of Replication]] (kicked) - 5 Wurms each gambling 3 times
- **Balance Assessment:** Strong but balanced at 6 mana. Floor of 6/6 trample is fair. With Krark's Thumb + counter doublers, ceiling is very high but requires setup
