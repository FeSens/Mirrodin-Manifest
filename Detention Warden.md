# Detention Warden

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Soldier Mer-Ikan

## Rules Text
> Detention Warden enters the battlefield with three detention counters on it.
>
> When Detention Warden enters the battlefield, exile any number of target creatures opponents control with total mana value 6 or less until Detention Warden leaves the battlefield. Put a detention counter on Detention Warden for each creature exiled this way.
>
> Detention Warden has indestructible as long as it has six or more detention counters on it.

## Flavor Text
> *"Capacity is not my concern."*

## Image Prompt
> A warden standing before rows of cells containing various creatures. The facility expands endlessly. Cold efficiency.

## Design Notes
- Mass exile with detention counters
- More detainees = more protection (indestructible)
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles detention counters, [[Market Crash]] releases all
- Detention facility mechanic
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - detention centers
- Pairs with: [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[Reprocessing Agent]], [[Family Separation Agent]]
