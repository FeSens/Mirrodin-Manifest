# Primal Surge

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Target creature gets +3/+3 until end of turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Tangle fights back."*

## Image Prompt
> A creature being enveloped in surging copper vines, growing massive with primal energy.

## Design Notes
- Green common instant - addresses Green common gap (-7)
- Classic giant growth effect
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Combat trick for limited
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Tangle Resistance]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Glistener Elf]] infect + pump = quick kills; [[Blighted Agent]] unblockable infect creature; Heroic triggers on [[Favored Hoplite]], [[Hero of Leina Tower]]
- **Potential Combos:** Infect creatures + this = 30% of lethal poison in one swing; [[Berserk]] double power then sacrifice for massive damage; [[Scale Up]] turns creature into 6/4, then +3/+3 = 9 damage
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Classic Giant Growth effect. Infect makes it dangerous but that's true of all pump spells
