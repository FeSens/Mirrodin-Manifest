# All-In Gambler

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Rogue

## Rules Text
> Haste
>
> Whenever All-In Gambler attacks, gamble. If you win, double All-In Gambler's power until end of turn. If you lose, sacrifice it at end of combat.

## Flavor Text
> *"I'm not reckless. I'm committed."*

## Image Prompt
> A wild-eyed gambler charging into battle, coins and dice flying around them. Glory or death, nothing in between.

## Design Notes
- Red rare creature - addresses Red rare gap (-10, critical!)
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] synergy - ultimate high-stakes card
- Win = 8 power attacker, Lose = sacrifice
- Haste for immediate impact
- Pairs with [[The House Edge]] (guaranteed double power)
- Core design philosophy of Red Gamble archetype

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Krark's Thumb]] gives 75% chance to double power (8 power attacker), only 25% sacrifice; [[Temur Battle Rage]] double strike + doubled power = 16+ damage; [[Unleash Fury]] stack power doublings for massive damage
- **Potential Combos:** [[Krark's Thumb]] + [[Fatal Frenzy]] quadruple power (4 -> 8 -> 16 power) for one-shot kills; [[Chance for Glory]] extra combat, can attack again with doubled power; [[Inquisitor's Flail]] damage doubling equipment stacks with power doubling
- **Balance Assessment:** Balanced by the sacrifice risk. With Krark's Thumb, becomes very reliable but still dies to removal. High-risk, high-reward as intended
