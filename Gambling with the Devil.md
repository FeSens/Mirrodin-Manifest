# Gambling with the Devil

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Gamble. *(You and target opponent reveal the top card of your libraries. Whoever reveals the card with greater mana value wins.)*
>
> The player who loses the gamble loses 6 life.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Golem at the table never blinks. He already knows your hand—he built the deck."*
> — Survivor of Ep-Styn's Isle

## Image Prompt
> A dimly lit chamber within a chrome fortress on Mirrodin, two figures seated at a metallic table covered in glowing mana-infused cards. One figure is a menacing iron golem with hollow red eyes, the other a desperate human artificer sweating under the heat of molten furnaces in the background. Flames and liquid gold reflect off every surface. The golem's hand hovers over the deck, fingers like bladed pistons. Dark, ominous atmosphere with deep reds, blacks, and orange furnace glow. MTG card art style, digital painting, cinematic lighting, Mirrodin metallic aesthetic.

## Design Notes
- Mechanic: [[🎲 GAMBLE]]
- High risk, high reward - both players are in danger
- Symmetrical punishment creates political tension
- At 2 mana, this is an aggressive tempo play for red decks with high-curve strategies
- Lore connection: References the dark dealings on Ep-Styn's Private Isle where the powerful gambled with things far more valuable than gold
- The flavor evokes the rigged nature of the games played by the elite in the Quicksilver Sea
