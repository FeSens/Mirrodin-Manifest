# Regime Propagandist

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Advisor

## Rules Text
> {T}: Put a narrative counter on target creature you control. It gains your choice of lifelink or deathtouch until end of turn.
>
> Creatures you control with narrative counters on them can't be the targets of spells or abilities opponents control that would cause you to sacrifice them.

## Flavor Text
> *"Heroes never fall. Traitors are never remembered."*

## Image Prompt
> A figure in elaborate robes projecting a holographic image that glorifies a leader while obscuring darker truths. The image flickers between propaganda and reality.

## Design Notes
- Narrative counters = controlling the story
- Grants keywords (spinning narratives)
- Protection from sacrifice effects (can't be removed by "investigations")
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles narrative counters, [[COMPOUND]] adds
- Orzhov propaganda machine
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - regime propaganda
- Pairs with: [[Put-In, the Iron Despot]], [[Control The Narrative]], [[Synod High Chancellor]]
