# ✅ **Core Definition (Clean & Rules-Safe)**

### **Redistribute — keyword action**

> **Redistribute — Choose two permanents. Count the total number of counters on them. Remove all counters from them, then put half that many counters on each of them, rounded down, of the same types.**

This is the most _correct_ and judge-safe wording.

### Why this wording matters

- MTG rules **cannot “move counters equally”** without explicitly removing and re-adding
    
- “Rounded down” ensures:
    
    - Loss of value
        
    - Permanent inefficiency
        
    - Ideological decay 😉

## Design goals

- Looks fair on paper
    
- Punishes asymmetry
    
- Destroys “rich” permanents
    
- Synergizes _anti-synergistically_ with **Compound**
    
- Feels bureaucratic, blunt, and inefficient
    
---

## 🧮 Example (why it feels bad)

- Permanent A: 7 +1/+1 counters
    
- Permanent B: 1 +1/+1 counter  
    → Total = 8  
    → Each gets 4
    

The strong one **loses 3**, the weak one gains **3**, net value = 0  
Now imagine mixed counter types — it gets even uglier.

## 📜 Reminder Text (for commons)

> _(To redistribute, choose two permanents. Remove all counters from them, then each gets half that many counters, rounded down.)_

## 🎭 Flavor Home Run

- **Equality ≠ fairness**
    
- **Everyone loses something**
    
- Growth is flattened
    
- Incentives disappear
    

This is _perfect_ social commentary without saying anything explicit.

## 🔁 Interaction with **Compound** (this is key)

### The tension:

- **Compound** rewards stacking value on one permanent
    
- **Redistribute** punishes concentration
    

This creates _actual gameplay politics_:

> “Do I compound now, or will it just get redistributed later?”

That’s brilliant set design.

## 🔥 Example Cards

### **Central Committee Enforcer** (Uncommon)

> Whenever a player compounds, redistribute.

💀 absolute menace

---

### **Planned Economy** (Enchantment)

> At the beginning of each end step, if a permanent has more counters than another permanent, redistribute.

This card alone defines the set.

## 🧠 Color Pie Suggestion

|Color|Redistribute Access|
|---|---|
|**White**|Primary (forced equality)|
|**Blue**|Conditional / political|
|**Black**|Weaponized redistribution|
|**Red**|Chaotic redistribution|
|**Green**|Almost none (green hates flattening growth)|
