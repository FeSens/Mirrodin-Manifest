## Image Prompt
> A humanoid creature's arm being branded with a glowing golden seal shaped like the Great Furnace. The seal radiates protective light.

## Design Notes
- Provides protection from exile effects (can't be "deported")
- Grants the Mer-Ikan creature type
- Simple common design with clear flavor
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - Represents legal status in the Foundry
- The vigilance represents "productive citizenship"
