>
> Whenever you compound, scry 1.
>
> {U}{U}, {T}: Look at the top card of each player's library.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Lattice sees all futures. I merely choose which one arrives."*

## Image Prompt
> An ancient Vedalken floating above the central node of the En-Vidia Lattice, eyes closed, surrounded by orbiting data streams. Their body is partially merged with chrome cables. The entire Seat of the Synod is visible below. Godlike presence, absolute knowledge.

## Design Notes
- Mythic AI lord that [[COMPOUND|compounds]] every turn
- Scry on compound creates powerful card selection engine
- Top-deck knowledge represents total information awareness
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]] - The Overseer of the En-Vidia Lattice
- Scry on compound synergizes with [[🎲 GAMBLE]] (information advantage before gambling)
- Pairs with: [[En-Vidia Processing Core]], [[Sal-Tman, Prophet of the Core-Logic]], [[Core-Logic Architect]], [[The House Edge]]
