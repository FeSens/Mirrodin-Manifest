## Image Prompt
> A bird's-eye view of a chrome Mirrodin city going dark sector by sector. The En-Vidia Lattice nodes flicker and die in sequence, spreading like a wave. Myr collapse mid-stride, their eyes going black. Defense turrets power down. Only the distant glow of approaching Foundry aircraft lights the scene. Digital corruption patterns overlay the image like a glitch. Blue and black color scheme, technological horror, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** U.S. Cyber Command blacked out Caracas before the raid; Trump stated "the city was largely blacked out ahead of the raid due to a certain expertise that we have"
- **Lore adaptation:** The Mer-Ikan Foundry using the En-Vidia Lattice against itself—hacking infrastructure
- Tapping artifacts and creatures represents disabling defenses and communications
- "Don't untap" represents sustained disruption
- Drawing a card represents intelligence gathering during the chaos
- The quote is adapted directly from Trump's statement about the operation
- Blue/Black represents the cyber warfare and covert nature
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - cyber warfare capabilities
- Pairs with: [[Operation Absolute Resolve]], [[Foundry Strike Team]], [[En-Vidia Processing Core]], [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]]
