# Spark Harvester

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Rogue

## Rules Text
> Deathtouch
>
> When Spark Harvester enters the battlefield, create a 1/1 white Human Unforged creature token with a spark counter on it.
>
> Sacrifice an Unforged: Add {B} for each spark counter on it. Draw a card. You lose 1 life.

## Flavor Text
> *"The academies call it 'recruitment.' The ledgers call it 'acquisition.' I call it business."*

## Image Prompt
> A gaunt, well-dressed human with cold calculating eyes, standing in a doorway offering a hand to a young figure whose face is illuminated by their own faint spark-glow. Behind the recruiter, a Glimmer-Barge waits at a hidden dock. The scene appears welcoming but shadows reveal restraints hidden in the recruiter's other hand. Blacks and deep purples with deceptive warm golden lighting on the victim. MTG card art style, predatory and deceptive.

## Design Notes
- Creates Unforged tokens with spark counters, then sacrifices them for value
- **Counter synergy:** [[Hype Cycle]] doubles spark counters → more mana on sacrifice
- [[Compound]] can grow individual Unforged before harvesting
- Deathtouch represents the danger of crossing them
- Life loss represents the moral cost
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - Recruiters for Ep-Styn's Spark Trade
- Mechanically rewards building around Unforged tribal + counter manipulation
