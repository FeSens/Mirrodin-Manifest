# Spark Harvester

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Rogue

## Rules Text
> Deathtouch
>
> When Spark Harvester enters the battlefield, create a 1/1 white Human Unforged creature token.
>
> Sacrifice an Unforged: Add {B}{B}. Draw a card. You lose 1 life.
>
> *"Such potential. Such value."*

## Flavor Text
> *"The academies call it 'recruitment.' The ledgers call it 'acquisition.' I call it business."*

## Image Prompt
> A gaunt, well-dressed human with cold calculating eyes, standing in a doorway offering a hand to a young figure whose face is illuminated by their own faint spark-glow. Behind the recruiter, a Glimmer-Barge waits at a hidden dock. The scene appears welcoming but shadows reveal restraints hidden in the recruiter's other hand. Blacks and deep purples with deceptive warm golden lighting on the victim. MTG card art style, predatory and deceptive.

## Design Notes
- Creates Unforged tokens then sacrifices them for value
- Black mana from exploitation
- Deathtouch represents the danger of crossing them
- Life loss represents the moral cost
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - Recruiters for Ep-Styn's Spark Trade
- Mechanically rewards building around Unforged tribal
