# Out of Touch Cards Report

This report identifies cards that may not fit the Mirrodin Manifest lore and setting.

---

## Summary

After analyzing 302 cards against the set's lore (Mirrodin corporate dystopia with AI/economic/political themes), here are the potential issues:

---

## Category 1: Too Real-World Names

These cards use real-world terminology too directly without enough Mirrodin flavor:

| Card Name | Issue | Suggestion |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **DREAM Act Advocate** | Direct US policy reference | Rename to "Asylum Pathway Advocate" or "Sanctuary Manifest Advocate" |
| **Bankruptcy Filing** | Too corporate/Earth | Rename to "Default Declaration" or "Forge Collapse" |
| **Hedge Fund Manager** | Too modern finance | Rename to "Glimmervoid Speculator" or "Aurum Hoarder" |

---

## Category 2: Cards Without Mirrodin Flavor

These cards feel generic and could be in any set:

| Card Name | Issue | Suggestion |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Primal Surge** | Generic green pump spell, no Mirrodin tie | Add Tangle reference or artifact interaction |
| **Desperate Charge** | Generic red combat trick | Tie to Furnace workers or rebellion theme |
| **Spark Surge** | Identical to Desperate Charge | Differentiate or cut one |

---

## Category 3: Creature Type Considerations

The set introduces custom creature types that ARE intentional and should stay:

### Valid Custom Types (Keep These)
- **Mer-Ikan** - America allegory faction (Foundry citizens/enforcers)
- **Unforged** - Trafficking victims (Ep-Styn theme)
- **Displaced** - Workers replaced by automation

### Types That Could Be Reconsidered
| Card | Current Type | Consideration |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| **Kha-Sino, Fortune's Dealer** | Leonin Cat | "Cat" is redundant with "Leonin" - just use "Leonin" |
| **Put-In, the Iron Despot** | Human Warlord | "Warlord" is unusual in modern MTG - consider "Warrior" or "Noble" |
| **Veiled Client** | Human Noble | "Noble" works but could be "Advisor" for consistency |

---

## Category 4: Duplicate Mechanics (See duplicate-text report)

Cards with identical rules text that need differentiation:
- **Spark Surge** & **Desperate Charge** (identical)
- **Sylvok Rejection** & **Primal Surge** (identical)

---

## Category 5: Potential Lore Conflicts

| Card | Issue |
|------|-------|
| **Fortune's Gardener** | "Gardener" feels too pastoral for metal Mirrodin. The Tangle has sylvok, but gardening is rare. |
| **Grove Warden** | Similar issue - "Grove" is fine (Tangle has groves) but "Warden" is generic |
| **Copper Myr Tender** | "Tender" is unusual - Myr don't typically need tending |

---

## Recommendations

### High Priority Fixes
1. Rename **DREAM Act Advocate** - too on-the-nose US politics
2. Rename **Hedge Fund Manager** - too modern Earth finance
3. Differentiate **Spark Surge** vs **Desperate Charge** - identical cards

### Medium Priority
1. Review generic green pump spells for Tangle/artifact flavor
2. Add more Mirrodin location references to flavorless cards
3. Consider if "Bankruptcy Filing" needs Mirrodin flavor

### Low Priority
1. Clean up redundant creature types (Leonin Cat → Leonin)
2. Review "Warlord" type for consistency

---

## Cards That Are Fine (False Positives)

These were flagged but are actually appropriate:

- **Mer-Ikan** creatures - Intentional America allegory
- **Unforged** creatures - Intentional trafficking theme
- **Saga** cards - Standard MTG card type
- **Vehicle** artifacts - Standard MTG card type
- **Equipment** artifacts - Standard MTG card type
- **Druid** creatures - Valid in the Tangle (Sylvok druids exist)
- **Berserker** creatures - Valid for Tangle warriors
