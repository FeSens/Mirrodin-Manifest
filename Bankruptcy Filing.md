# Bankruptcy Filing

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Destroy all [[Debt Token|Debt tokens]] you control. You can't create Debt tokens until end of turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Tangle knows no currency."*

## Image Prompt
> A figure in green robes standing in a forest clearing, burning all their debt contracts in a ritual fire. The forest embraces them as they reject the artificial economy. Nature's rejection of debt, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- Green common sorcery
- Self-debt removal at just {G}
- Downside: can't create Debt this turn (prevents abuse with debt-for-benefit cards)
- Green's philosophy: reject the debt system entirely
- Addresses Green common gap
- Pairs with: [[Natural Economy]], [[Inflation Hedge]]
