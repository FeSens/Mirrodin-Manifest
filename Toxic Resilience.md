# Toxic Resilience

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Target creature gets +1/+1 and gains deathtouch until end of turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"What doesn't kill you becomes a weapon."*

## Image Prompt
> A creature's wounds seeping with black ichor, their touch now lethal.

## Design Notes
- Black common instant - addresses Black common gap (-6)
- Combat trick with deathtouch
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Good interaction for limited
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Dross (Mephidross)]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Fynn, the Fangbearer]] deathtouch creatures deal poison counters; [[Hooded Blightfang]] deathtouch attackers drain life and draw; [[Zagras, Thief of Heartbeats]] party synergy with deathtouch
- **Potential Combos:** [[Toski, Bearer of Secrets]] indestructible + deathtouch = guaranteed trades and draws; Creatures with trample + deathtouch only need 1 damage to kill, rest tramples; [[Bow of Nylea]] gives deathtouch to first striker = devastating
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Efficient combat trick at 1 mana. Deathtouch grant is powerful but temporary
