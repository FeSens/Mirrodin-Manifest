## Design Notes
- Blue rare creature - addresses Blue rare gap (-1)
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] synergy - massive gamble enabler and payoff
- "Whenever you gamble, draw a card" is extremely powerful
- Activated ability lets you gamble repeatedly (at cost)
- Pairs with [[The House Edge]], [[Chaos Theorist]], [[Profit Taker]]
- Blue angle: gambling for information

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Krark's Thumb]] gives 75% win rate + drawing a card on EVERY gamble; [[Chance Encounter]] for rapid luck counter accumulation; [[Alhammarret's Archive]] doubles cards drawn
- **Potential Combos:** [[Intruder Alarm]] + token generators creates infinite gamble/draw loops; [[Mind Over Matter]] discard to untap, gamble, draw to refuel; [[Teferi's Ageless Insight]] draws 2 per gamble
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN - "Whenever you gamble, draw a card" provides excessive card advantage with cheap gamble sources. Consider adding "once each turn" restriction or increasing mana cost
