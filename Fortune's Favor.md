## Design Notes
- **Gamble payoff hub** - rewards BOTH winning AND losing
- Connects ALL gamble cards: [[All-In Gambler]], [[Gambling with the Devil]], [[Lucky Strike]], [[Jackpot Wurm]], [[Reckless Wager]], [[Wild Growth Gambit]], [[Pyromantic Gambit]], [[Flames of Fortune]], [[Gamble with Fate]], [[Gambler's Instinct]]
- Creates [[Gold Token]] synergy with [[Hedge]], [[Hedge Fund Manager]], [[Aurum Standard]]
- Draw + damage = Red gets value either way
- Pairs with [[The House Edge]] (guaranteed wins = guaranteed draws)
- Pairs with [[Den of Chance]] location
