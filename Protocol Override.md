## Design Notes
- **Blue utility connector** - useful spell that links themes
- Connects: [[Freeze Protocol]], [[Lattice Analyst]], [[Synod's Rejection]], [[Processing Queue]], [[Lattice Interface]]
- Stifle effect + cantrip
- Answers abilities (including gamble triggers, counter abilities, etc.)
- Synergizes with [[The House Edge]] (counter opponent's gamble trigger)
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]]
- Pairs with: [[Synod High Chancellor]], [[Control The Narrative]]
- NWO compliant - simple but versatile

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Functions as a strictly better [[Stifle]] with cantrip. Works well with any deck running counter-magic or control strategies
- **Potential Combos:** Can counter fetch land activations (like [[Flooded Strand]]), [[Aether Vial]] triggers, planeswalker abilities, and persist/undying triggers. Similar to [[Nimble Obstructionist]] but as an instant
- **Balance Assessment:** Strong but not broken. The cantrip attached to a Stifle effect at 2 mana is above rate but acceptable at common for limited
