# Liang-Wen, the Efficient Mind

## Card Type Line
Legendary Creature — Human Artificer

## Rules Text
> Artifact spells you cast cost {1} less to cast.
>
> Whenever you cast an artifact spell, if its mana value is less than the highest mana value among artifacts your opponents control, draw a card.
>
> *"Constraints breed innovation. Sanctions bred me."*

## Power/Toughness
> 2/3

## Flavor Text
> *He built an empire from scraps they said were worthless.*

## Image Prompt
> A young human artificer in practical Oxidda work clothes, surrounded by efficient, elegant Myr designs. His workshop is modest—copper pipes, recycled parts, minimal ornamentation—but the constructs he's building rival the chrome perfection of the En-Vidia Lattice. His expression is focused, confident. Behind him, a banned En-Vidia Core sits useless; in front of him, his own creation hums with equal power. Red and blue lighting, innovation from limitation, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Liang Wenfeng, founder of DeepSeek, who built competitive AI despite US chip sanctions
- **Lore:** Founder of the Deep-Sik Collective in the Oxidda Chain
- Cost reduction rewards efficient artifact builds
- Card draw triggers when you're doing more with less (lower mana value than opponents)
- Blue/Red for innovation, artifice, and defiance
- The quote references how US sanctions forced Chinese AI companies to innovate
- Pairs with: [[Deep-Sik Efficiency]], [[The Sanctions War]]
