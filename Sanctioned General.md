# Sanctioned General

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Soldier

## Rules Text
> Sanctioned General enters the battlefield with three sanction counters on it.
>
> Sanctioned General has menace and deathtouch as long as it has no sanction counters on it.
>
> At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a sanction counter from Sanctioned General. You lose 2 life for each sanction counter removed this way.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Synod's sanctions mean nothing. We have the Vault's gold."*

## Image Prompt
> A decorated general counting gold coins, oblivious to the economic pressure closing in. Documents stamped "SANCTIONED" pile up unread.

## Design Notes
- Sanction counters represent international pressure
- Loses counters over time (sanctions wear off or are bypassed)
- Gains power when unsanctioned
- Life loss = economic damage from sanctions
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] can double sanction counters, prolonging weakness
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Deep-Sik Collective (DeepSeek / Chinese AI)]] - [[The Sanctions War]]
- Pairs with: [[Put-In, the Iron Despot]], [[The Sanctions War]], [[Nim Occupation Force]]
