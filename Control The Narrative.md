# Control The Narrative

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> As Control The Narrative enters, choose two creature types.
>
> Creatures of the first chosen type have protection from creatures of the second chosen type.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Glimmer-Barge logs told stories the Synod refused to read. When the Unforged finally spoke, the chamber had already adjourned—permanently."*
> — Sealed Testimony, Vault Record ██████

## Image Prompt
> A page from the Black Ledger lying on a chrome desk within the Seat of the Synod. Most text is obscured by thick black bars of solidified ink, applied by small Redaction-Myr whose metallic appendages drip with dark fluid. A few visible words hint at names of High Artificers, dates, and coordinates to the Private Isle. The Synod's official seal glows faintly in the corner, half-covered. The lighting is cold chrome and blue, institutional Vedalken aesthetic. In the reflection of the polished surface, the silhouette of a hooded figure watches. Mirrodin chrome architecture visible through a window. MTG card art style, digital painting, bureaucratic horror meets metallic dystopia.

## Design Notes
- Mechanic: Global protection enchantment - represents systemic, institutional cover-up across the entire plane
- Choose two creature types: the first is protected FROM the second (e.g., "Vedalken have protection from Unforged")
- **Lore connection:** [[Lore#The Great Ep-Styn Mystery]] - Directly references the Redacted Archives and the Synod's complicity
- White/Black represents the corruption of Synod institutions (white order) by Vault self-interest (black secrecy)
- References the Glimmer-Barges that transported the Unforged to Ep-Styn's Private Isle
- The Redaction-Myr in the art are the literal censors who scrubbed the Black Ledger
- Gameplay: Name "Vedalken" and "Unforged" to protect corrupt Synod officials from victim testimony
- Or flip it: Name "Unforged" and "Mer-Ikan" to protect survivors from Reprocessing Agents
- The asymmetry is intentional—whoever controls the narrative decides who is untouchable
- Pairs thematically with: [[The Black Ledger]], [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]], [[Unforged Witness]]
