# Central Planner

## Card Type Line
Creature — Vedalken Advisor

## Rules Text
> At the beginning of your upkeep, if any permanent has more counters on it than another permanent with counters on it, redistribute. *(Choose two permanents. Remove all counters from them, then each gets half that many counters, rounded down.)*

## Flavor Text
> *"Inequality is inefficiency. Inefficiency is unacceptable."*

## Image Prompt
> A stern Vedalken with measuring instruments, adjusting counters on a scale. Everything must be equal. Everything must be planned.

## Design Notes
- Forces [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] when inequality exists
- Anti-[[COMPOUND]], anti-accumulation - key tension in the mechanical triangle
- From [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] example cards
- Planned economy enforcer
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Deep-Sik Collective (DeepSeek / Chinese AI)]] - planned economy ideology
- Pairs with: [[Mak-Ron, the Glass Orator]], [[Austerity Minister]], [[Free Market Zealot]]

## Cross-Format Interactions
| External Card | Interaction |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Planeswalkers** | Forces redistribution of loyalty counters - can protect low-loyalty walkers or weaken high-loyalty ones |
| **Solemnity** | With no counters on permanents, Central Planner never triggers |
| **Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider** | Vorinclex doubles your counters, triggers Central Planner constantly |
| **Doubling Season** | Creates massive counter inequality, triggers redistribution every upkeep |
| **Atraxa, Praetors' Voice** | Proliferate creates inequality → forced redistribution |
| **Hardened Scales / Winding Constrictor** | Asymmetric counter growth triggers redistribution |
| **Sagas** | Redistributes lore counters - can accelerate or delay chapter progression! |
| **Poison Counters** | Does NOT affect poison (counters on players, not permanents) |

**Format Assessment:**
- **Commander**: Powerful political tool - prevents any single threat from accumulating counters
- **Modern/Legacy**: Shuts down Hardened Scales, Heliod combo, Walking Ballista strategies
- **Cube**: Strong counter-hoser that creates interesting decisions
