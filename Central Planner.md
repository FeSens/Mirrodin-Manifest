# Central Planner

## Card Type Line
Creature — Vedalken Advisor

## Rules Text
> At the beginning of your upkeep, if any permanent has more counters on it than another permanent with counters on it, redistribute. *(Choose two permanents. Remove all counters from them, then each gets half that many counters, rounded down.)*

## Flavor Text
> *"Inequality is inefficiency. Inefficiency is unacceptable."*

## Image Prompt
> A stern Vedalken with measuring instruments, adjusting counters on a scale. Everything must be equal. Everything must be planned.

## Design Notes
- Forces [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] when inequality exists
- Anti-[[COMPOUND]], anti-accumulation - key tension in the mechanical triangle
- From [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] example cards
- Planned economy enforcer
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Deep-Sik Collective (DeepSeek / Chinese AI)]] - planned economy ideology
- Pairs with: [[Mak-Ron, the Glass Orator]], [[Austerity Minister]], [[Free Market Zealot]]
