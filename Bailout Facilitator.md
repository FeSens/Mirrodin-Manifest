# Bailout Facilitator

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Advisor

## Rules Text
> When Bailout Facilitator enters the battlefield, return target artifact creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield with three +1/+1 counters on it. It's a treasure in addition to its other types.
>
> {2}, Sacrifice an artifact: Draw a card.

## Flavor Text
> *"Too big to fail. Too connected to punish."*

## Image Prompt
> A bureaucrat presenting a gleaming restored construct to cheering officials while workers look on in dismay. Taxpayer gold flows into the machine.

## Design Notes
- Reanimates artifact creatures (corporate bailout)
- Adds +1/+1 counters (government support)
- Becomes treasure (public money)
- Sacrifice for cards (liquidation)
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles +1/+1 counters, [[COMPOUND]] adds more
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Great Doubt (The AI Hype Correction)]] - corporate rescues
- Pairs with: [[Quantitative Easer]], [[Hedge Fund Manager]], [[Trickle-Down Theorist]]
