# Extraction Squad Leader

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Soldier Mer-Ikan

## Rules Text
> When Extraction Squad Leader enters the battlefield, exile target creature an opponent controls with mana value 3 or less. Put two -1/-1 counters on it when it returns.
>
> Other Mer-Ikan creatures you control get +1/+0.

## Flavor Text
> *"Voluntary departure... or assisted extraction. Choose quickly."*

## Image Prompt
> An armored squad leader directing soldiers who drag a creature toward a processing center. Efficient, cold, organized.

## Design Notes
- Banisher Priest variant with -1/-1 trauma
- Lords other Mer-Ikans
- Extraction = deportation
- Processing marks remain (-1/-1 counters synergize with [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]])
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - deportation squads
- Pairs with: [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[Reprocessing Agent]], [[Foundry Border Commander]], [[Simulated Labor Myr]], [[Inflation Harbinger]]
