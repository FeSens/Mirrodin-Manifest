# Mephidross Refugee

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Citizen

## Rules Text
> Mephidross Refugee can't block.
>
> When Mephidross Refugee is exiled, its owner may pay 2 life. If they do, return it to their hand.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Dross is poison. The Wall is death. I choose the poison I know."*

## Image Prompt
> A haggard figure fleeing the toxic Mephidross swamps, looking back at the gleaming Darksteel Wall blocking their path. Caught between horrors.

## Design Notes
- 1-drop that can evade deportation (exile)
- Can't block (not there to fight)
- Returns to hand when exiled (tries again)
- Mephidross = origin they're fleeing
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - refugees fleeing the Mephidross
- Pairs with: [[The Darksteel Wall]], [[Desperate Crosser]], [[Tunneling Hopeful]]
