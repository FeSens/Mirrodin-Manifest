# Simulated Labor Myr

## Card Type Line
Artifact Creature — Myr

## Rules Text
> {T}: Add {C}. Put a -1/-1 counter on target non-Myr creature you control.

## Flavor Text
> *"Every task it completes is one fewer for you."*

## Image Prompt
> A small, efficient Myr unit working at a forge while a human worker watches helplessly from the background, tools idle in their hands. The Myr's movements are precise, inhuman. Industrial displacement.

## Design Notes
- 1-drop mana dork with a cost: hurts your organic creatures
- Represents AI job displacement mechanically
- -1/-1 counters synergize with [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] (spread the pain)
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]] - The Myr performing "Simulated Labor"
- Pairs with: [[Myr-Sourced Automation]], [[Displaced Worker]], [[Optimization Lie]]
