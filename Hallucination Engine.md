# Hallucination Engine

## Card Type Line
Artifact Creature — Construct

## Rules Text
> Whenever you scry, put a glitch counter on Hallucination Engine.
>
> {T}, Remove three glitch counters from Hallucination Engine: Create a token that's a copy of target creature, except it's an artifact in addition to its other types. Sacrifice it at the beginning of the next end step.

## Flavor Text
> *"It looks real. It acts real. It isn't."*

## Image Prompt
> A chrome machine projecting a flickering holographic duplicate of a warrior. The projection glitches and distorts at the edges, clearly artificial. Other incomplete projections hover nearby. AI hallucination made manifest.

## Design Notes
- Represents AI hallucinations/confabulations
- Scry triggers (common in set) build glitch counters
- Temporary copies = hallucinations that fade
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles glitch counters for more hallucinations, [[COMPOUND]] adds
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Great Doubt (The AI Hype Correction)]] - AI unreliability
- Scry triggers synergize with [[🎲 GAMBLE]] (scry before gambling)
- Pairs with: [[Sal-Tman, Prophet of the Core-Logic]], [[Trough of Disillusionment]], [[The Vibe Shift]], [[The House Edge]]
