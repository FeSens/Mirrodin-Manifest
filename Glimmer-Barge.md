# Glimmer-Barge

## Card Type Line
Artifact — Vehicle

## Rules Text
> Whenever Glimmer-Barge attacks, you may exile target creature with mana value 2 or less until Glimmer-Barge leaves the battlefield. If that creature was an Unforged, draw a card.
>
> Glimmer-Barge can't be blocked.
>
> Crew 1 *(Tap any number of creatures you control with total power 1 or more: This Vehicle becomes an artifact creature until end of turn.)*

## Flavor Text
> *No manifests. No witnesses. No returns.*

## Power/Toughness
4/3

## Image Prompt
> A sleek, unmarked vessel with mirrored chrome hull gliding silently across the Quicksilver Sea at night. The liquid metal sea reflects no light. Small, dim figures huddle in the cargo hold, barely visible through slitted windows. The Private Isle looms in the distant fog. Dark silvers, blacks, and muted quicksilver reflections. MTG card art style, sinister and stealthy, noir atmosphere.

## Design Notes
- Vehicle represents the transport used for trafficking
- Can't be blocked = operates in secrecy
- Exiles small creatures (the vulnerable)
- Low crew cost = few people needed to operate
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - The vessels that carried the Unforged to Ep-Styn's Isle
