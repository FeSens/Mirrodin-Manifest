## Design Notes
- Introduces Prompt-Sculptor creature type from [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]]
- Scry represents AI prediction, [[COMPOUND]] represents iterative improvement
- Entry-level card for the AI theme
- Scry synergizes with [[🎲 GAMBLE]] (stack the deck before gambling)
- Pairs with: [[En-Vidia Processing Core]], [[Sal-Tman, Prophet of the Core-Logic]], [[Hallucination Engine]], [[The House Edge]]
