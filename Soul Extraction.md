# Soul Extraction

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Destroy target creature. Its controller loses 2 life.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Isle takes more than just bodies."*

## Image Prompt
> Dark energy being ripped from a victim, their soul visibly torn away and absorbed into shadows.

## Design Notes
- Black common sorcery - addresses Black common gap (-6)
- Creature removal with life loss
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Lore connection: [[Lore#Ep-Styn's Silent Isle (Epstein)]]
- Pairs with: [[Spark Harvester]], [[Isle Procurer]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Gray Merchant of Asphodel]] black devotion and life drain synergy; [[Sanguine Bond]] life loss becomes additional damage; [[Torment of Hailfire]] decks incidental life loss adds pressure
- **Potential Combos:** [[Wound Reflection]] doubles the life loss to 4; [[Archfiend of Despair]] another life loss doubler; [[Vito, Thorn of the Dusk Rose]] if you have lifegain this adds to the drain plan
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Standard unconditional removal with life loss rider. Appropriately costed at 3 mana for common
