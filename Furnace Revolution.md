# Furnace Revolution

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Gain control of all artifacts until end of turn. Untap them. They become artifact creatures with base power and toughness 4/4 with haste until end of turn.
>
> At the beginning of the next end step, sacrifice each artifact you gained control of this way.

## Flavor Text
> *"The machines rose against their masters, if only for a glorious moment."*

## Image Prompt
> Myr and constructs turning against the Foundry overseers, metal hands raised in rebellion, the Great Furnace blazing behind them.

## Design Notes
- Red mythic sorcery - addresses Red mythic gap (-3)
- Splashy game-ending effect
- Threaten all artifacts simultaneously
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]]
- Pairs with: [[Myr-Sourced Automation]], [[Simulated Labor Myr]]
