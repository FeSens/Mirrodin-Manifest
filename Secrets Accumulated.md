# Secrets Accumulated

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> Whenever a counter is placed on a permanent you control, if it's the first counter of that type on that permanent, put a secrecy counter on Secrets Accumulated.
>
> {B}, Remove three secrecy counters from Secrets Accumulated: Each opponent discards a card. You draw a card.
>
> {2}{B}, Remove five secrecy counters: Destroy target creature. Its controller loses life equal to its power.

## Flavor Text
> *"Every secret is currency. Every name, a weapon."*

## Image Prompt
> A black tome chained to a pedestal, its pages glowing with accumulated names and secrets. Counter-like symbols orbit it, each representing a different type of hidden knowledge.

## Design Notes
- **Secrecy counter hub** - accumulates from all counter types
- Connects: [[Isle Procurer]], [[Keeper of the Guest List]], [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]], [[Ledger Thief]]
- Counter diversity rewards running multiple counter types
- Synergizes with [[Hype Cycle]] (doubles secrecy counters)
- Synergizes with [[Market Crash]] (lose all secrets = cover-up)
- Pairs with [[The Black Ledger]], [[Control The Narrative]], [[Veiled Client]]
- Black's theme: information is power

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Doubling Season]] doubles secrecy counters placed; [[Proliferate effects]] add more secrecy counters; [[Hardened Scales]] extra counters on all counter placement
- **POTENTIALLY BROKEN Combos:** [[Heliod, Sun-Crowned]] + [[Walking Ballista]] infinite +1/+1 counters = infinite secrecy counters; [[Devoted Druid]] + [[Vizier of Remedies]] infinite -1/-1 counters placed = infinite secrecy; [[Mikaeus, the Unhallowed]] + persist creature infinite death/undying triggers with counters
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN - This triggers on ANY counter type's first placement. Infinite counter combos (like Heliod/Ballista) generate infinite secrecy counters, which can be used for infinite discard or removal. Consider adding "once per turn" or limiting to specific counter types
