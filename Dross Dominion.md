- **Zombie/Dross tribal hub** - connects Mephidross cards
- Connects: [[Dross Executioner]], [[Dross Harvester]], [[Mephidross Scavenger]], [[Mephidross Refugee]], [[Rusted Nim Conscript]], [[Nim Occupation Force]]
- Death trigger creates zombie army
- Graveyard synergy with exile-to-draw
- Lore connection: [[Lore#Put-In, the Iron Despot]] - the endless Nim legions
- Pairs with: [[Put-In, the Iron Despot]], [[Soul Extraction]], [[Spark Harvester]]
