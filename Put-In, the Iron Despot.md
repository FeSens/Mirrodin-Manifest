# Put-In, the Iron Despot

## Card Type Line
Legendary Creature — Human Warlord

## Rules Text
> Menace
>
> At the beginning of your upkeep, create a 2/2 black Nim Zombie creature token with a rust counter on it.
>
> Nim creatures you control have "When this creature dies, if it had a rust counter on it, return it to the battlefield tapped at the beginning of the next end step."
>
> {2}{B}: Put a rust counter on target creature you don't control. It gets -1/-1 until end of turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"Special Acquisitions continue. They always continue."*

## Image Prompt
> A gaunt, pale human warlord in black iron armor, seated on a throne of rusted metal in the Vault of Whispers. Nim zombies march endlessly behind him. His eyes are cold, calculating. Eternal war.

## Design Notes
- Put-In from [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - Putin allegory
- Creates zombie army that won't stay dead
- Counter synergy: Rust counters enable recursion and weaken enemies, [[Hype Cycle]] doubles them
- [[Market Crash]] wipes rust counters, potentially killing the army
- Pairs with: [[Zel-Ensk, the Resilient Spark]], [[Nim Occupation Force]], [[Rusted Nim Conscript]], [[The Sanctions War]]
