# Deep-Sik Efficiency

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Copy target activated or triggered ability from an artifact source. You may choose new targets for the copy.
>
> *"They spent a billion on that effect. We replicated it for pennies."*

## Flavor Text
> *The Oxidda Chain proved that efficiency beats extravagance.*

## Image Prompt
> A sleek, minimalist Myr design emerging from rough-hewn copper and iron in an Oxidda forge. The Myr is smaller and simpler than En-Vidia constructs but glows with the same inner light. In the background, a massive, ornate En-Vidia Processing Core sits idle while the humble Myr performs the same task. Red and orange Oxidda mountains in the background. Efficiency over opulence. MTG card art style, contrast between simple and complex.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** DeepSeek matching OpenAI's capabilities at a fraction of the cost
- **Lore:** The Deep-Sik Collective from the Oxidda Chain doing more with less
- At 1 mana, this is extremely efficient—copying expensive artifact abilities cheaply
- Blue for copying/replication effects
- The flavor is pure DeepSeek: "You paid how much for that? We did it cheaper."
- Pairs with: [[En-Vidia Processing Core]], [[Liang-Wen, the Efficient Mind]]
