# Mirrodin Manifest - Set Bible

*The definitive guide to the mechanical identity, flavor, and design philosophy of Mirrodin Manifest.*

---

## Set Overview

**Set Name:** Mirrodin Manifest
**Plane:** Mirrodin (post-Phyrexian, corporate dystopia)
**Set Size:** 261 cards (target)
**Primary Themes:** Counter manipulation, economic satire, AI/automation allegory

### Elevator Pitch

> Mirrodin has evolved from a metal world into a hyper-calculated corporate dystopia. The "Thought-Sync" network of sentient Myr automates labor while the En-Vidia Lattice promises infinite growth. Political factions fight for control while an underground network traffics the "Unforged"—young beings whose sparks have not yet bonded. The bubble is about to burst.

---

## Core Mechanics Triangle

The three primary mechanics form an **ideological triangle** that creates natural tension:

| Mechanic | Philosophy | Gameplay Effect | Primary Colors |
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **GAMBLE** | Risk & volatility | Creates variance | Red, Green, Blue |
| **COMPOUND** | Capital accumulation | Amplifies inequality | Blue, Black, Green |
| **REDISTRIBUTE** | Forced equality | Destroys efficiency | White, Blue, Black |

### Mechanical Tensions

- **COMPOUND vs REDISTRIBUTE:** Growth vs forced equality
- **GAMBLE vs COMPOUND:** Volatility vs predictable gains
- **GAMBLE vs REDISTRIBUTE:** Individual risk vs collective leveling

This creates genuine gameplay politics and deckbuilding decisions.

---

## Mechanic #1: GAMBLE

### Definition

> **Gamble** — Choose target opponent. You and that player reveal the top card of your libraries. The player who revealed the card with the greater mana value wins the gamble. If the mana values are equal, the active player wins the gamble.

### Reminder Text

> *(To gamble, you and target opponent reveal the top card of your libraries. Whoever reveals the card with greater mana value wins.)*

### Design Rules

1. Cards must explicitly define win/loss effects: "If you win the gamble..." / "If you lose the gamble..."
2. Loss conditions must matter—no free value
3. Appears primarily at Common/Uncommon
4. Scry before Gamble is powerful (intentionally)

### Flavor Identity

- High-cost decks = long-term investors
- Low-cost decks = volatility traders
- Ties favor active player = timing matters
- Knowledge (scry) = market manipulation

### Color Distribution

| Color | Access Level | Flavor |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **Red** | Primary | Reckless gambling, chaos |
| **Green** | Secondary | Natural chance, growth bets |
| **Blue** | Secondary | Calculated risk, knowledge advantage |
| **Black** | Tertiary | Desperate gambles |
| **White** | Rare | Only when forced or defensive |

---

## Mechanic #2: COMPOUND

### Definition

> **Compound** — Choose a permanent. Put a counter on it of a type already on it.

### Reminder Text

> *(To compound, choose a permanent and add a counter to it of a type already on it.)*

### Design Rules

1. One target only (unlike Proliferate's many)
2. Mandatory once triggered
3. Feels predatory—value concentrates
4. Best at Uncommon+, few engines at Common
5. Sagas + Compound accelerates chapters—limit carefully

### Flavor Identity

- Interest-on-interest
- The rich get richer
- No redistribution, no fairness
- Pure exponential growth

### Why COMPOUND Is Not Proliferate

| Proliferate | Compound |
|-------------|----------|
| Many targets | One target |
| Optional per permanent | Mandatory |
| Broad | Focused |
| Egalitarian | Asymmetric |

### Color Distribution

| Color | Access Level | Flavor |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **Blue** | Primary | Calculated growth |
| **Black** | Primary | Exploitation |
| **Green** | Secondary | Natural accumulation |
| **Red** | Tertiary | Explosive short-term |
| **White** | Rare | Only with heavy restrictions |

---

## Mechanic #3: REDISTRIBUTE

### Definition

> **Redistribute** — Choose two permanents. Count the total number of counters on them. Remove all counters from them, then put half that many counters on each of them, rounded down, of the same types.

### Reminder Text

> *(To redistribute, choose two permanents. Remove all counters from them, then each gets half that many counters, rounded down.)*

### Design Rules

1. Always results in net counter loss (rounding down)
2. Destroys concentrated value
3. Can target opponent permanents (weaponized)
4. Anti-synergy with COMPOUND by design

### Flavor Identity

- Equality ≠ fairness
- Everyone loses something
- Growth is flattened
- Incentives disappear
- Bureaucratic, blunt, inefficient

### Example Calculation

- Permanent A: 7 counters
- Permanent B: 1 counter
- Total: 8 counters
- After Redistribute: 4 each
- Net result: A loses 3, B gains 3, total unchanged but concentration destroyed

### Color Distribution

| Color | Access Level | Flavor |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **White** | Primary | Forced equality, law |
| **Blue** | Secondary | Political/conditional |
| **Black** | Secondary | Weaponized redistribution |
| **Red** | Tertiary | Chaotic redistribution |
| **Green** | Rare | Green hates flattening growth |

## Tokens

### Debt Token

**Type:** Token Artifact — Debt
**Rules:** Enters with two debt counters. At the beginning of your upkeep, you lose 1 life, then remove a debt counter. When the last debt counter is removed, sacrifice it.

**Synergies:**
- COMPOUND adds debt counters = extends duration
- REDISTRIBUTE moves debt between tokens
- Sacrifice outlets (Ashnod's Altar) can avoid damage
- Artifact synergies count Debt = leveraging debt for gain

**Flavor:** Paper promises, financial obligation

### Gold Token

**Type:** Token Artifact — Gold
**Rules:** Enters with a value counter. Sacrifice: Add {C} for each value counter on it.

**Synergies:**
- COMPOUND increases Gold's worth
- Market Crash removes all counters = instant devaluation
- Gamble often rewards with Gold
- Unlike Treasure, Gold has variable value

**Flavor:** Physical gold as a safe haven against the Thought-Sync crash

### Other Tokens

| Token | Type | Created By |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Myr** | 1/1 Colorless Artifact Creature | Myr tribal cards |
| **Unforged** | 1/1 Creature (often with spark counter) | Ep-Styn cards, trafficking theme |
| **Zombie/Nim** | 2/2 Black Zombie | Dross/Mephidross cards |

## Design Principles

### 1. Counters Are Currency
Every counter type represents something tradeable, accumulable, or exploitable. The economy of counters IS the gameplay.

### 2. Mechanics Teach Ideology
COMPOUND shows how wealth concentrates. REDISTRIBUTE shows the inefficiency of forced equality. GAMBLE shows volatility. Players learn through play.

### 3. Satire Through Flavor, Not Rules
Card names, flavor text, and art carry the political commentary. Mechanics are agnostic—let players draw conclusions.

### 4. The Bubble Must Pop
The set should feel like mounting tension. Cards like Market Crash, The Lattice Crashes, and Hype Cycle Chapter III represent the inevitable correction.

### 5. Everyone Is Complicit
No faction is purely heroic. Tromp is authoritarian. Sal-Tman is a hype merchant. The Tangle resists but can't stop progress. Even victims become currency.

---

## Balance Watchlist

Cards tagged with `broken-needs-review` require rebalancing before finalization. Common issues:

1. **Infinite combos** with persist, Intruder Alarm, or Ashnod's Altar
2. **Undercosted effects** (especially 1-mana copy effects)
3. **Counter manipulation** breaking planeswalkers or sagas
4. **Token generation** without sufficient cost
5. **Stax effects** that create hard locks
