# Sal-Tman, Prophet of the Core-Logic

## Card Type Line
Legendary Creature — Human Artificer

## Rules Text
> At the beginning of your upkeep, you may pay {2}. If you do, create a 1/1 colorless Myr artifact creature token with "This creature can't attack or block."
>
> {T}: Add {C}{C}{C}. Spend this mana only to cast artifact spells or activate abilities of artifacts. At the beginning of your next end step, you lose 3 life unless you control more artifacts than you did when this ability resolved.
>
> *"True intelligence is always one year away."*

## Power/Toughness
> 2/4

## Flavor Text
> *He promised the future. He delivered quarterly reports.*

## Image Prompt
> A charismatic human in immaculate white and blue robes, arms spread wide before a massive crowd. Behind him, a holographic projection shows a radiant, perfect Myr-Mind—but the projection flickers, revealing incompleteness beneath the polish. His smile is practiced, his eyes calculating. Vedalken investors watch with mixture of hope and doubt. The Seat of the Synod's chrome spires rise in the background. Messianic tech CEO energy, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI
- **Lore:** Leader of the Thought-Sync movement, perpetually promising AGI
- The Myr tokens can't attack or block—they're impressive but useless (vaporware)
- The mana ability represents massive spending that requires growth to justify
- "Lose 3 life unless you have more artifacts" = spend now, profit later mentality
- 2/4 stats: defensive, a talker not a fighter
- The perpetual "one year away" quote is directly from AGI criticism
- Pairs with: [[The Orb-Seekers]], [[Compute Debt]], [[Sal-Tman's Promise]]
