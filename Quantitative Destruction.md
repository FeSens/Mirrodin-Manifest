# Quantitative Destruction

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Each opponent creates X [[Debt Token|Debt tokens]], where X is the number of artifacts you control. Then redistribute among all Debt tokens.

## Flavor Text
> *"Print money. Spread the consequences."*

## Image Prompt
> Izzet artificers operating a massive money-printing machine that spews out debt contracts instead of currency. The contracts spread across the landscape like a plague while the operators redistribute the fallout. Reckless economic policy, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- Izzet rare sorcery
- Rewards artifact-heavy builds
- Mass debt creation based on your artifacts
- Redistribution spreads the pain
- [[Lore]] connection: quantitative easing critique
- Pairs with: [[En-Vidia Processing Core]], [[Compute Debt]]
