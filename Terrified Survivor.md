# Terrified Survivor

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Soldier

## Rules Text
> Defender
>
> Terrified Survivor enters the battlefield with two -1/-1 counters on it.
>
> {W}, Remove a -1/-1 counter from Terrified Survivor: Prevent the next 2 damage that would be dealt to you this turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"I never want to be on the other side of that again. They're not to be messed with."*

## Power/Toughness
> 3/5

## Image Prompt
> A haggard soldier in dented, worn armor sitting against a chrome wall, blood dried under his nose and around his ears. His eyes are hollow, staring at nothing. His weapon lies abandoned beside him. Other soldiers in similar condition are visible in the background, some being tended to by medics. The scene is aftermath—survival without victory. Muted colors, shell-shocked atmosphere, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Venezuelan guard who survived the raid and gave testimony about the sonic weapon
- **Counter synergy:** -1/-1 counters represent trauma; base stats 3/5, but enters as 1/3
- [[Hype Cycle]] doubles -1/-1 counters → trauma worsens, but Chapter III heals!
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] can spread trauma to others, or receive it
- Remove counters = recovery, can be healed by +1/+1 counter effects
- Defender represents trauma—he's done attacking
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - military operation aftermath
- Pairs with: [[Resonance Disruptor]], [[Foundry Strike Team]], [[Operation Absolute Resolve]], [[Simulated Labor Myr]], [[Inflation Harbinger]]
