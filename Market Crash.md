# Market Crash

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Remove all counters from all permanents.
>
> Each player loses 1 life for each counter removed from permanents they controlled this way.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Lattice promised infinite growth. It never mentioned the floor."*
> — Last transmission from the Synod Trading Floor

## Image Prompt
> The interior of the Seat of the Synod's trading floor in chaos. Holographic charts plummet to zero as Vedalken traders scream and clutch their heads. Mana crystals shatter and go dark. Gold tokens evaporate into worthless vapor. A massive En-Vidia node explodes in the background, sending sparks everywhere. One trader leaps from a balcony. Harsh reds cutting through cold blues, panic lighting, screens filled with downward arrows. MTG card art style, financial apocalypse, 1929 crash aesthetic meets sci-fi.

## Design Notes
- Clean, devastating effect at instant speed
- Hits +1/+1, -1/-1, charge, loyalty, lore, poison — everything
- Life loss adds additional punishment proportional to investment
- Synergy: Response to [[Hype Cycle]] Chapter II for maximum carnage
- Anti-synergy: Devastating if opponent casts after your counters doubled
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - The inevitable crash of the En-Vidia Lattice bubble
- Black gets "everyone suffers" symmetrical effects
