# The Rigged Game

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Scry 2, then gamble.
>
> If you win the gamble, compound twice.
>
> If you lose the gamble, redistribute.

## Flavor Text
> *Win, and the wealth compounds. Lose, and everyone shares the pain. Either way, you're never the one who suffers.*

## Image Prompt
> A gambling table in a Glimmervoid back room, viewed from above. One player's hand is visible holding cards while their other hand secretly manipulates a mirror beneath the table, showing the opponent's deck. The table surface reflects probabilities and mana values in faint chrome light. The other players are oblivious, focused on their hands. The cheater's expression is serene confidence. Dim gold lighting, intimate corruption, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- **Mechanic:** Touches all three set mechanics — Scry (gamble support), Gamble, Compound, Redistribute
- **The Rigged Game:** Scry 2 lets you stack the deck in your favor before gambling
- WIN: You compound twice — exponential growth as reward for your "skill"
- LOSE: You redistribute — if you somehow still lose, tear down the winner's advantage
- Either outcome benefits you or hurts your opponent; there's no clean loss
- Mono-blue because it's pure manipulation without the predatory black edge
- Cheaper than Market Manipulation (3 vs 4 mana) but less explosive
- **Philosophy:** The powerful never truly lose — they just change the rules
- Pairs with: [[The House Edge]], [[Market Manipulation]], [[🎲 GAMBLE]], [[COMPOUND]], [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]]
