# Mak-Ron, the Glass Orator

## Card Type Line
Legendary Creature — Vedalken Advisor

## Rules Text
> At the beginning of your upkeep, scry 2.
>
> {U}, {T}: Choose one —
> • Redistribute. *(Choose two permanents. Remove all counters from them, then each gets half that many counters, rounded down.)*
> • Each player draws a card.
>
> *"Integration requires... adjustment."*

## Flavor Text
> *"His speeches promise everything. The Quicksilver Sea evaporates regardless."*

## Image Prompt
> A tall Vedalken in pristine white robes giving a sweeping speech from a crystal podium. Behind him, the Quicksilver Sea visibly recedes. His audience nods, unaware. Eloquent futility.

## Design Notes
- Mak-Ron from [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - Macron allegory
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] on command (forced equality politics)
- Or group draw (diplomatic negotiation)
- Scry for "calculated" speeches
- Scry 2 each upkeep synergizes with [[🎲 GAMBLE]] (information advantage)
- Pairs with: [[Synod High Chancellor]], [[Hype Cycle]], [[Austerity Minister]], [[Opposition Leader]], [[The House Edge]]
