# Bailout Package

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Destroy target artifact. Its controller creates two [[Debt Token|Debt tokens]].

## Flavor Text
> *"The Foundry saves you—but the Foundry never forgets."*

## Image Prompt
> A massive chrome hand descending from above to lift a failing forge, but chains of debt wrap around the forge as it's "saved." Bureaucrats in white robes observe with clipboards. Corporate salvation with strings attached, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- White uncommon sorcery
- Artifact removal with debt creation rider
- "Help" that comes with strings attached
- Flavorful: bailouts create debt
- [[Lore]] connection: government intervention themes
- Pairs with: [[Central Bank Governor]], [[Debt Restructuring]]
