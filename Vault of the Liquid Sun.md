# Vault of the Liquid Sun

## Card Type Line
Land

## Rules Text
> Vault of the Liquid Sun enters the battlefield tapped.
>
> {T}: Add {C}.
>
> {T}: Add one mana of any color. Spend this mana only to cast artifact spells.
>
> {3}, {T}: Create a Gold token. *(It's an artifact that enters with a value counter. It has "Sacrifice this artifact: Add {C} for each value counter on it.")*
>
> *When the Lattice fails, only gold remains.*

## Flavor Text
> *"The Myr-Mind calculates futures. The Vault holds certainties."*

## Image Prompt
> A vast underground vault within the Glimmervoid, filled with pools of molten gold that are slowly solidifying into pure ingots. Vedalken bankers carefully catalog each pool while worried investors watch the En-Vidia Lattice flicker on monitors above. The gold glows with warm, stable light contrasting the erratic blue pulses of the Lattice. Warm golds, amber, and anxious blue flickers. MTG card art style, treasury atmosphere, safe haven amid chaos.

## Design Notes
- Mana fixing for artifacts
- Creates Gold tokens (the gold rally)
- Slow but reliable value generation
- Enters tapped for balance
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Glimmervoid Rally (Gold Rally)]] - The Aurum Surge and Glimmervoid gold rally
- Safe haven for those who don't trust the Thought-Sync
- [[Gold Token]] synergy: Creates Gold for [[🎲 GAMBLE]] and [[COMPOUND]] strategies
- Pairs with: [[Hedge Fund Manager]], [[Quantitative Easer]], [[Gold Token]], [[The House Edge]]
