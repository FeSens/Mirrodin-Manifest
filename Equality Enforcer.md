# Equality Enforcer

## Card Type Line
Artifact Creature — Construct

## Rules Text
> Vigilance
>
> At the beginning of your end step, if any permanent has three or more counters on it than another permanent with counters, redistribute.

## Flavor Text
> *"Imbalance detected. Correction initiated."*

## Image Prompt
> A towering white construct with scales for hands, constantly measuring and redistributing. Its eyes glow with mechanical fairness.

## Design Notes
- White uncommon creature - addresses White uncommon gap (-4)
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] synergy - automatic redistribution engine
- Anti-[[COMPOUND]] design - punishes counter accumulation
- Vigilance for defensive presence
- From [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] design philosophy - forced equality
- Pairs with [[Central Planner]], [[Austerity Minister]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Solemnity]] complete lockout - no counters can be placed at all; [[Vampire Hexmage]] can remove counters before redistribution; Works against Superfriends, +1/+1 counter strategies
- **Potential Combos:** Against Planeswalkers - keeps loyalty low across all walkers; Against Energy decks - redistributes energy counters (if applicable); [[Thassa, Deep-Dwelling]] flicker to reset vigilance and maintain enforcement
- **Balance Assessment:** Strong hate piece against counter strategies. The automatic trigger can be oppressive against certain decks
