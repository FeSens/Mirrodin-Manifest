# Asylum Seeker

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Citizen

## Rules Text
> Asylum Seeker enters the battlefield with a hope counter on it.
>
> As long as Asylum Seeker has a hope counter on it, it has hexproof and "Whenever this creature is dealt damage, put a +1/+1 counter on it."
>
> When Asylum Seeker becomes the target of a spell or ability an opponent controls, remove all hope counters from it.

## Flavor Text
> *"I came seeking safety. I found only waiting."*

## Image Prompt
> A weary figure sitting at a processing desk, papers in hand, hope fading from their eyes. The wait continues.

## Design Notes
- Hope counter provides protection
- Grows from adversity (+1/+1 from damage)
- Loses hope when targeted (system breaks you)
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles hope = more resilience, [[Market Crash]] removes all hope
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - refugees seeking safety
- Pairs with: [[The Darksteel Wall]], [[Sanctuary City Warden]], [[DREAM Act Advocate]]
