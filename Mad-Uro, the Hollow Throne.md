# Mad-Uro, the Hollow Throne

## Card Type Line
Legendary Creature — Human Advisor

## Rules Text
> Mad-Uro, the Hollow Throne enters the battlefield with four loyalty counters on it.
>
> Other creatures you control have "{T}: Add {B} or {R}. Remove a loyalty counter from Mad-Uro."
>
> At the beginning of your end step, if Mad-Uro has no loyalty counters on it or you control fewer than three other creatures, sacrifice it.
>
> When Mad-Uro dies, each opponent draws cards equal to the number of loyalty counters that were on it.

## Flavor Text
> *His people starved while his fortress gleamed. When the Foundry came, not one guard stood in their way.*

## Power/Toughness
> 2/4

## Image Prompt
> A corpulent figure in gaudy, oil-stained robes of red and black sitting on an oversized chrome throne. His face is sweating, eyes darting nervously. The throne room is opulent but crumbling—gold leaf peeling, myr servants standing motionless and unpowered. Through tall windows, fires burn in the distance. He clutches the armrests with white knuckles. A hollow crown sits crooked on his head. Mirrodin aesthetic meets decaying autocracy, paranoid atmosphere, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Nicolás Maduro, Venezuelan president captured during Operation Absolute Resolve
- **Counter synergy:** Loyalty counters drain as you exploit your people for mana
- [[Hype Cycle]] doubles loyalty (false hope!) but Chapter III strips it all
- [[Compound]] can restore loyalty, [[Market Crash]] removes all support instantly
- Death trigger scales inversely—die with loyalty = opponents gain intel
- 2/4 stats: defensive, not a fighter himself
- Black/Red represents tyranny, desperation, and resource extraction
- Pairs with: [[Operation Absolute Resolve]], [[Sanctum of the Despot]], [[Terrified Survivor]]
