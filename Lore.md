Welcome back to the silver world. In the upcoming (fictional) set **Mirrodin Manifest**, the plane hasn’t just survived the Phyrexians; it has evolved into a hyper-calculated corporate dystopia. The "AI Boom" is represented by the **Thought-Sync**, a network of sentient Myr that has begun to automate the very souls of the inhabitants.

Here is the masked lore of **Mirrodin Manifest**:

### The High Artificers (Political Figures)

- **Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel (Trump):** A legendary Loxodon artificer who has seized the **Great Furnace**. He claims he will "Make the Core Solid Again" by building a massive Darksteel Wall to keep out the "unrefined" Golems from the Mephidross. His power comes from a literal "Gilded" shimmer that blinds his opponents.
    
- **Mak-Ron, the Glass Orator (Macron):** A high-ranking Vedalken from the **Seat of the Synod**. He constantly gives sweeping speeches about "Continental Integration" while the Quicksilver Sea around him literally evaporates due to the heat of the new industry.
    
- **Put-In, the Iron Despot (Putin):** A warlord of the **Vault of Whispers** who has begun "Special Acquisitions" of neighboring territories, claiming they were historically part of the original Dross. He relies on a legion of rusted Nim zombies that never seem to stop marching.
    
- **Zel-Ensk, the Resilient Spark (Zelensky):** A Leonin rebel leader whose home was the first to be invaded by Iron Despot. He has become the face of the "Global Resistance," famously refusing to leave his watchtower by saying, _"I don't need a Blinkmoth transport; I need more Equipment."_
    

### The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)

- **The En-Vidia Lattice:** A massive, plane-wide web of "Processing Cores" (Mana-crystals) that everyone is fighting over. It doesn't produce mana; it produces **Calculated Futures**.
    
- **The Myr-Mind (AI):** The Myr have stopped serving. They now perform "Simulated Labor," and the organic inhabitants are finding that their own decision-making is being outsourced to a central **Core-Logic**.
    
- **The Artifact Creature — "Prompt-Sculptor":** A new class of wizard that doesn't cast spells, but "prompts" the En-Vidia Lattice to manifest them.
    

### The Great Ep-Styn Mystery

- **Ep-Styn, Keeper of the Private Isle:** A shadowy figure who owned a remote island in the **Quicksilver Sea**. It was rumored that the high-ranking Artificers of the Synod went there to exchange "Unprocessed Sparks."

- **The Redacted Archives:** A major plot point in the set is the discovery of Ep-Styn's "Black Ledger," a list of every leader who visited the isle. However, the **Redaction-Myr** have scrubbed the ink from the pages, leaving the players to hunt for the "Unmasked" versions.

- **Ep-Styn's Fate:** The flavor text on the card _Leash of Secrets_ reads: _"The Golem did not dismantle himself."_

#### The Unforged (Trafficked Victims)

- **Creature Type — Unforged:** Young beings from across Mirrodin, taken before their "tempering" was complete. Ep-Styn and his network harvested these incomplete souls, trafficking them to the Private Isle where the powerful came to exploit their raw, unprocessed essence.

- **The Spark Trade:** The Unforged were valued for their "pre-ignition potential"—sparks that had not yet bonded to a purpose. The elite believed consuming or binding these sparks would extend their own power. The trade was hidden beneath layers of legitimacy: "apprenticeship programs," "spark refinement academies," and "mentorship forges."

- **The Glimmer-Barges:** Unmarked vessels that crossed the Quicksilver Sea at night, carrying the Unforged to the Isle. Few ever returned. Those who did were... changed. Silent. Their sparks dimmed.

- **The Veiled Clients:** The Black Ledger contained not just names, but transaction records. High Artificers, Synod officials, even figures from the Mer-Ikan Foundry. When Ep-Styn was "dismantled," the Ledger vanished—but copies are said to exist, waiting to surface.

- **Flavor Text (Unforged Witness):** _"They told me I was special. That I had potential. They were right—I was currency."_
    

### The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)

The **Great Furnace** and surrounding territories have unified under a single banner: **The Mer-Ikan Foundry**. Once a coalition of independent forges, it is now ruled by Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel, who has centralized power around the doctrine of "Core Purity."

- **The Foundry's Doctrine:** Only those forged within the Furnace are true Mer-Ikans. All others—especially the "unrefined" from the Mephidross and the drifters from the Quicksilver Sea—must be **Reprocessed** (exiled) back to their origin zones.

- **Creature Type — Mer-Ikan:** A new creature type representing the enforcers and citizens of the Foundry. Mer-Ikans specialize in exile effects, artifact taxation, and "border" mechanics that prevent creatures from entering the battlefield freely.

- **The Reprocessing Agents:** An elite force of artifact creatures tasked with identifying and removing "unregistered" beings from Foundry territory. They don't destroy—they **exile**, sending targets to the "Blind Eternities Processing Queue."

- **The Darksteel Wall:** Tromp's greatest project—a massive barrier of indestructible Darksteel separating the Furnace from the Mephidross. Critics say it's impossible to complete; Tromp says the Mephidross will pay for it in extracted ore.

- **The Furnace Decree:** _"If it wasn't forged here, it doesn't belong here."_

### The Glimmervoid Rally (Gold Rally)

- **The Aurum Surge:** Suddenly, the "Liquid Gold" within the **Glimmervoid** has begun to harden and rise in value. While the En-Vidia Lattice controls the "Future," the hardened Gold has become the only "Safe Haven" for those who fear the Thought-Sync will crash.
