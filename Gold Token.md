# Gold Token

## Card Type Line
Token Artifact — Gold

## Rules Text
> *(Gold tokens enter the battlefield with a value counter on them.)*
>
> Sacrifice this artifact: Add {C} for each value counter on this artifact.

## Flavor Text
> *"The only currency the Lattice can't calculate."*

## Image Prompt
> A gleaming ingot of pure hardened gold from the Glimmervoid, hovering slightly above a reflective chrome surface. Etched into its surface is a single glowing rune representing its value. The gold radiates warm, stable light in contrast to the cold blue flickers of En-Vidia energy in the background. Rich gold and amber tones, metallic reflections. MTG token art style, precious and solid, safe haven aesthetic.

## Design Notes
- Created by: [[Hedge]], [[Vault of the Liquid Sun]], and other gold-generating cards
- Enters with 1 value counter (worth {C} by default)
- Synergies:
  - [[Hype Cycle]] doubles counters → Gold worth 2, then 4, then crashes to 0
  - [[Market Crash]] removes all counters → instant devaluation
  - Counter-adding effects let you "invest" before cashing out
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Glimmervoid Rally (Gold Rally)]] - The Aurum Surge / Glimmervoid Rally
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] synergy: Gold is often a reward for winning gambles
- [[COMPOUND]] synergy: Add value counters to increase Gold's worth
- Represents physical gold as a hedge against the Thought-Sync crash
- Unlike Treasure tokens, Gold has variable value based on market conditions
- Pairs with: [[Hedge Fund Manager]], [[Glimmervoid Broker]], [[Quantitative Easer]], [[Free Market Zealot]]
