# Tel-Jilad Defender

## Card Type Line
Creature — Troll Warrior

## Rules Text
> Trample
>
> Tel-Jilad Defender can't be blocked by artifact creatures.

## Flavor Text
> *"Metal breaks. The Tangle endures."*

## Image Prompt
> A massive Troll covered in living copper moss, smashing through a line of Myr constructs.

## Design Notes
- Green common creature - addresses Green common gap (-7)
- Trample plus artifact creature evasion
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Tangle Resistance]]
- Pairs with: [[Caravan Survivor]], [[Hidden Community Elder]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Troll tribal limited support but thematic; [[Garruk's Uprising]] draws card on ETB, gives trample (redundant but triggers); [[Rhonas the Indomitable]] can fight, deathtouch + trample
- **Artifact-Heavy Format Considerations:** Strong in Mirrodin/Kaladesh-heavy metas; Excellent against Myr tribal decks; Good against Affinity strategies; Evasion against Urza artifact decks
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Conditional evasion is meta-dependent. Strong in artifact formats but balanced in general play
