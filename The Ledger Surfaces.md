# The Ledger Surfaces

## Card Type Line
Enchantment — Saga

## Rules Text
> *(As this Saga enters and after your draw step, add a lore counter. Sacrifice after IV.)*
>
> **I** — Create two 1/1 black Unforged creature tokens with spark counters on them.
>
> **II** — Each opponent reveals their hand. You choose a nonland card from each and exile it.
>
> **III** — For each card exiled with this Saga, that card's owner loses 3 life unless they sacrifice a creature.
>
> **IV** — Return all cards exiled with this Saga to their owners' hands. Each player draws cards equal to the number of creatures that died this turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"The names were always there. Someone just had to read them aloud."*

## Image Prompt
> A massive chrome tome rising from the Quicksilver Sea, pages flipping open by themselves, names glowing on each page. Shadowy figures of High Artificers recoiling in horror as their names illuminate. Unforged spirits swirling around the book, finally being acknowledged. The Seat of the Synod visible in the background, its lights flickering. White light of truth cutting through black shadows of secrecy. MTG card art style, revelation, justice, reckoning.

## Design Notes
- **Saga synergy:** [[Hype Cycle]] doubles lore counters = skip to later chapters faster
- **Unforged synergy:** Creates tokens with spark counters for [[Spark Harvester]], [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]]
- **Political theme:** The truth comes out, but at a cost—Chapter IV returns the evidence
- **Lore connection:** [[Lore#The Great Ep-Styn Mystery]], [[The Black Ledger]], [[Control The Narrative]]
- **Color pair:** Orzhov (W/B) - secrets, sacrifice, justice
- **Pairs with:** [[The Black Ledger]], [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]], [[Unforged Witness]], [[Veiled Client]], [[Silenced Accuser]]
- The rich can pay their way out (sacrifice) or suffer exposure (life loss)
- Chapter IV shows how the powerful always escape—evidence returned, but witnesses created
