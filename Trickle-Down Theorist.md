# Trickle-Down Theorist

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Advisor

## Rules Text
> At the beginning of your end step, compound. Put the counter on a permanent with the most counters on it.
>
> Whenever a permanent you control with five or more counters on it leaves the battlefield, each other creature you control gets a +1/+1 counter.

## Flavor Text
> *"Concentrate wealth at the top. It will flow down... eventually."*

## Image Prompt
> A wealthy figure atop a tower of gold, a single coin falling toward distant workers below. They never catch it.

## Design Notes
- Forces [[COMPOUND]] on the richest permanent
- "Trickle down" only happens when the rich one dies
- Satirical take on trickle-down economics
- Counter concentration mechanic - pairs with [[Hype Cycle]] for exponential wealth
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Glimmervoid Rally (Gold Rally)]] - economic ideology
- Pairs with: [[Free Market Zealot]], [[Austerity Minister]], [[Bailout Facilitator]]
