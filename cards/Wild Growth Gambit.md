# Wild Growth Gambit

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Gamble. If you win the gamble, search your library for a basic land card, put it onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle. If you lose, search your library for a basic land card, put it into your hand, then shuffle.

## Flavor Text
> *"Nature rewards the bold. Or at least, the lucky."*

## Image Prompt
> Wild Growth Gambit — Sorcery. Action depicted: A Sylvok druid casting seeds with uncertain fates, some sprouting massively, others wilting. Setting: The Tangle clearing — where nature's gamble plays out. Focal point: Seeds mid-transformation, viewer uncertain which will thrive or fail, land magic swirling. Mood: Genuine hope. Style reference: Rebecca Guay. Color palette: Copper, forest green, glowing seed energy, uncertain growth light.

## Design Notes
- Green common sorcery - addresses Green common gap (-16)
- Addresses common creature ratio issue
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] synergy - Green gets gamble too!
- Win = ramp (land to battlefield), Lose = still get land to hand
- Floor is still useful, ceiling is powerful for common
- Pairs with [[The House Edge]] for guaranteed ramp

## Cross-Format Interactions
| External Card | Interaction |
|---------------|-------------|
| **[[Krark's Thumb]]** | Improves gamble odds significantly |
| **Library Manipulation** ([[Worldly Tutor]], [[Sylvan Library]]) | Stack high CMC on top to win |
| **Landfall Triggers** ([[Lotus Cobra]], [[Omnath, Locus of Creation]]) | Win = immediate landfall trigger |
| **[[Amulet of Vigor]]** | Land enters untapped on win = immediate mana |
| **[[Tireless Provisioner]]** | Creates Food/Treasure on landfall |
| **[[Crucible of Worlds]]** | Can replay lands if game goes long |
| **High CMC Deck Building** | Decks with expensive cards naturally win more gambles |

**Format Assessment:**
- **Commander**: Excellent - floor is Lay of the Land, ceiling is Rampant Growth
- **Modern/Legacy**: Compares favorably to other 2-mana ramp with upside variance
- **Limited**: Premium common - ramp is always valuable, and floor is still playable
