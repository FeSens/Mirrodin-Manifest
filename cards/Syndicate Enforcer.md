# Syndicate Enforcer

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Rogue

## Rules Text
> {1}, Sacrifice another creature: Draw a card. You lose 1 life.

## Flavor Text
> *"Everyone pays eventually. Some just pay with more than gold."*

## Power/Toughness
> 2/3

## Image Prompt
> Syndicate Enforcer, Human Rogue from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Vault of Whispers back alley — chrome walls with no witnesses. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Pose: Standing over a cowering debtor, one hand extended for payment, the other holding something unseen behind back. Key visual elements: Dark attire with hidden chrome plating, iron-veined hands scarred from collection work, cold calculating eyes that have seen worse. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Near-black, dark olive, gold debt tokens scattered.

## Design Notes
- Black uncommon sacrifice outlet
- Card draw engine for aristocrats
- Synergizes with tokens and recursion
- Pairs with: [[Loan Shark]], [[Vulture Capitalist]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Gravecrawler]] (sacrifice, recast, repeat with Zombie), [[Reassembling Skeleton]] (1B to return and sacrifice again), [[Bloodghast]] (free recurring sacrifice fodder), [[Pitiless Plunderer]] (Treasure on each sacrifice)
- **Notable Combos:** [[Gravecrawler]] + Syndicate Enforcer + [[Phyrexian Altar]] (now requires 1 extra mana per loop - no longer infinite). [[Reassembling Skeleton]] + [[Pitiless Plunderer]] (sacrifice for card, Treasure, pay 1B to return, pay 1 to activate - mana neutral card draw)
- **Balance Assessment:** FIXED - Added {1} activation cost prevents free infinite combos. Now comparable to [[Vampiric Rites]] but on a creature body. The mana cost makes infinite loops require additional pieces.
