## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Advisor

## Rules Text
> Haste
>
> Whenever Furnace Populist attacks, gamble with target opponent. If you win, put a +1/+1 counter on Furnace Populist. *(To gamble, you and that player each reveal the top card of your libraries. Whoever reveals the card with greater mana value wins. If equal, the active player wins.)*

## Flavor Text
> *"The people want action! The Synod wants studies! I bring fire!"*

## Image Prompt
> Furnace Populist, Human Advisor from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Great Furnace/Oxidda — rally platform before worker crowd. Mood: Buried rage. Pose: Fist raised, speaking passionately to cheering workers, flames of the Furnace roaring behind. Key visual elements: Iron-veined face flushed with fervor, red robes billowing, crowd of workers below with raised fists, +1/+1 growth potential visible. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Furnace orange, copper robes, bronze worker crowd, dark red flames.

## Design Notes
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] on every attack (volatile politics)
- Grows when winning, hurts when losing
- Counter synergy: +1/+1 counters synergize with [[Hype Cycle]]
- Haste = immediate action
- Red aggro politician archetype
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - populist politics
- Pairs with: [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[The House Edge]], [[Glimmervoid Broker]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Krark, the Thumbless]] (coin flip commander), [[Hardened Scales]] (extra counters on wins), [[Tavern Scoundrel]] (coin flip synergy), [[Mirror March]] (red gambling theme)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Fun gamble design. Self-damage keeps it balanced.
