# Furnace Populist

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Advisor

## Rules Text
> Haste
>
> Whenever Furnace Populist attacks, Gamble. If you win the gamble, put a +1/+1 counter on Furnace Populist. If you lose the gamble, Furnace Populist deals 2 damage to you.

## Flavor Text
> *"The people want action! The Synod wants studies! I bring fire!"*

## Image Prompt
> A fiery human politician in red robes, fist raised, speaking to a crowd of cheering workers. The Great Furnace roars behind them. Passionate, reckless, popular.

## Design Notes
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] on every attack (volatile politics)
- Grows when winning, hurts when losing
- Counter synergy: +1/+1 counters synergize with [[Hype Cycle]]
- Haste = immediate action
- Red aggro politician archetype
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - populist politics
- Pairs with: [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[The House Edge]], [[Glimmervoid Broker]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Krark, the Thumbless]] (coin flip commander), [[Hardened Scales]] (extra counters on wins), [[Tavern Scoundrel]] (coin flip synergy), [[Mirror March]] (red gambling theme)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Fun gamble design. Self-damage keeps it balanced.
