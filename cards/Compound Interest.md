# Compound Interest

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Put two debt counters on target [[Debt Token|Debt token]].

## Flavor Text
> *"The debt grows faster than you can pay."*

## Image Prompt
> A debt contract growing and multiplying, numbers spiraling upward exponentially. A debtor watches in horror as their small debt becomes massive. The mathematics of financial doom. MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- Black uncommon instant
- Increases debt amount significantly (+2 damage when due)
- Simple and direct debt acceleration
- Instant speed allows combat tricks or response to removal
- Pairs with: [[Loan Shark]], [[Interest Rate Hike]], [[Debt Accumulator]]

## Cross-Format Interactions
| External Card | Interaction |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Proliferate** (Atraxa, Inexorable Tide) | Proliferate also adds debt counters - stacks with this |
| **Doubling Season** | Does NOT double counters placed by spells (only entering/effects you control placing on your permanents) |
| **Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider** | Opponent's Vorinclex halves counters you place on their Debt |
| **Solemnity** | Prevents debt counters from being placed entirely |
| **Hex Parasite** | Opponent can pay life to remove debt counters |
| **Chisei, Heart of Oceans** | Can remove debt counters at upkeep |

**Format Assessment:**
- **Limited**: Key uncommon for Debt strategies - turns 1-damage Debt into 3-damage
- **Constructed**: Narrow but powerful in Debt-focused decks
- **Cross-set**: Works with any future Debt token creators
