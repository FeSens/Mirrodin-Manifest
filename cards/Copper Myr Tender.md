## Image Prompt
> Copper Myr Tender, Elf Druid from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Tangle — beneath copper-leafed trees in a hidden grove. Mood: Genuine hope. Pose: Kneeling beside a damaged Myr, hands weaving organic copper fibers into its frame. Key visual elements: Metallic hair with copper streaks, iron-veined hands glowing green, Myr's eyes flickering to life. Style reference: Rebecca Guay meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Copper, forest green, olive.

## Design Notes
- Green common creature - addresses Green common gap (-7)
- Mana dork with artifact creature synergy
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Tangle Resistance]]
- Pairs with: [[Simulated Labor Myr]], [[Myr Replicant]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Myr Galvanizer]] untaps all Myr including this; [[Palladium Myr]] mana Myr synergy; [[Steel Overseer]] puts counters on artifact creatures
- **Potential Combos:** [[Clock of Omens]] tap artifacts to untap this repeatedly; [[Voltaic Key]] untap artifact creatures for more mana; [[Dramatic Reversal]] + [[Isochron Scepter]] infinite mana with mana dorks
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - The untap ability being sorcery-speed prevents most infinite combos. Solid mana dork with artifact synergy but not broken
