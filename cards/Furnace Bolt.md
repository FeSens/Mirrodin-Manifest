## Design Notes
- Red common instant - addresses Red common gap (-9)
- Simple burn spell for NWO compliance
- Standard Red removal at common
- 1 mana for 2 damage is classic rate
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Torbran, Thane of Red Fell]] (becomes 4 damage), [[Guttersnipe]] (triggers on cast), [[Young Pyromancer]] (creates tokens), [[Lightning Bolt]] (compare: strictly worse but still good)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Shock variant. Perfectly balanced common.
