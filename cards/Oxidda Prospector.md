# Oxidda Prospector

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Rogue

## Rules Text
> Whenever Oxidda Prospector deals combat damage to a player, create a Gold token. *(A Gold token is an artifact with a value counter on it and "Sacrifice this artifact: Add {C} for each value counter on it.")*

## Flavor Text
> *"Every punch is an investment."*

## Power/Toughness
> 2/2

## Image Prompt
> Oxidda Prospector, Human Rogue from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Oxidda mountain mining territory — a contested gold vein. Mood: Buried rage, opportunistic aggression. Pose: Mid-swing with a pickaxe, gold dust coating iron-veined arms, having just broken through a rival's claim marker. Key visual elements: Scrappy human with chrome-streaked hair, gold dust on weathered clothes, fierce determination in copper-flecked eyes, mining gear doubling as weapons. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Wayne Reynolds. Color palette: Furnace orange, copper, gold dust highlights, Oxidda mountain reds.

## Design Notes
- Red creature that creates Gold tokens
- Supports the economic theme of the set
- Rewards aggressive gameplay
- Pairs with: [[Glimmervoid Broker]], [[Gold Rush Frenzy]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Goldspan Dragon]] (treasures tap for double, similar to Gold), [[Academy Manufactor]] (if Gold counts, get Food and Clue too), [[Revel in Riches]] (win condition with Treasures/Gold), [[Inspiring Statuary]] (improvise with Gold)
- **Potential Combos:** [[Aggravated Assault]] + enough Gold (extra combats, more Gold, but need 5 Gold per combat). [[Time Sieve]] (5 artifacts = extra turn)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - 3 mana 2/2 that needs to connect for value is below rate. Compare to [[Professional Face-Breaker]] (3 mana 2/3 menace, creates Treasure on ANY creature dealing damage). This is significantly worse.
