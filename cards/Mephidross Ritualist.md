## Image Prompt
> Mephidross Ritualist, Human Warlock from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Dross Dominion — a ritual circle in the depths of Mephidross swamp. Mood: Corrupted triumph, dark purpose. Pose: Kneeling with chrome-veined arms raised, pulling spectral forms up from the bubbling muck as spirits answer the call. Key visual elements: Black ritual robes absorbing light, necrogen-green runes glowing in the air, ghostly chrome-boned spirits rising from the swamp. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: Near-black, dark olive, necrogen green ritual glow, ghostly silver spirits.

## Design Notes
- Black uncommon recursion
- Creature-based Raise Dead effect
- Solid value for graveyard strategies
- Pairs with: [[Toxic Reclamation]], [[Soul Extraction]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Ephemerate]] / [[Ghostly Flicker]] (repeated recursion), [[Panharmonicon]] (double recursion), [[Karmic Guide]] / [[Reveillark]] (recursion chains), [[Tortured Existence]] (graveyard manipulation)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Gravedigger variant at uncommon. BB is restrictive, appropriate power level.
