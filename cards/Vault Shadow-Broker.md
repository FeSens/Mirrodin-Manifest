# Vault Shadow-Broker

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Rogue

## Rules Text
> At the beginning of your upkeep, each opponent loses 1 life. You gain life equal to the life lost this way. Put a corruption counter on Vault Shadow-Broker.
>
> {B}{B}, {T}, Remove three corruption counters from Vault Shadow-Broker: Gain control of target creature with mana value 3 or less for as long as you control Vault Shadow-Broker.

## Flavor Text
> *"Everyone has a price. I ensure they can afford it."*

## Image Prompt
> Vault Shadow-Broker, Human Rogue from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Vault of Whispers — private chamber of secrets and leverage. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Pose: Seated among ledgers and blackmail documents, predatory smile visible beneath hood. Key visual elements: Chrome-touched features barely visible under hood, corruption counters accumulating nearby, coins and secrets flowing equally through their hands. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Near-black shadows, dark olive, necrogen glow on documents.

## Design Notes
- Drains life each turn (corruption tax)
- Counter synergy: Corruption counters fuel mind control (buying politicians), [[Hype Cycle]] doubles
- [[COMPOUND]] adds more corruption counters
- Black political corruption archetype
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - political corruption
- Pairs with: [[Glimmervoid Lobbyist]], [[The Black Ledger]], [[Veiled Client]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Proliferate, [[Doubling Season]], multiplayer games
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** With proliferate, can rapidly accumulate corruption counters for repeated mind control
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - 4 mana, requires 3 turns to activate steal, limited targets
