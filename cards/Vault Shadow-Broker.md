# Vault Shadow-Broker

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Rogue

## Rules Text
> At the beginning of your upkeep, each opponent loses 1 life. You gain life equal to the life lost this way. Put a corruption counter on Vault Shadow-Broker.
>
> {B}{B}, {T}, Remove three corruption counters from Vault Shadow-Broker: Gain control of target creature with mana value 3 or less for as long as you control Vault Shadow-Broker.

## Flavor Text
> *"Everyone has a price. I ensure they can afford it."*

## Image Prompt
> A hooded figure in the Vault of Whispers, surrounded by ledgers and blackmail documents. Their smile is predatory. Coins and secrets flow equally.

## Design Notes
- Drains life each turn (corruption tax)
- Counter synergy: Corruption counters fuel mind control (buying politicians), [[Hype Cycle]] doubles
- [[COMPOUND]] adds more corruption counters
- Black political corruption archetype
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - political corruption
- Pairs with: [[Glimmervoid Lobbyist]], [[The Black Ledger]], [[Veiled Client]]
