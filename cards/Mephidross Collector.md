## Power/Toughness
> 2/2

## Image Prompt
> Mephidross Collector, Zombie from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Dross Dominion — the toxic shores of Mephidross where debris washes up. Mood: Exhaustion, grim duty. Pose: Hunched over, methodically filling a corroded bag with chrome bones and artifact fragments from the muck. Key visual elements: Rotting flesh over visible metal skeleton, necrogen-dulled eyes focused on work, swamp debris clinging to form. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Daarken. Color palette: Near-black, dark olive, necrogen sickly glow, corroded metal browns.

## Design Notes
- Black 3-drop with mill effect
- Fills graveyard for recursion strategies
- Symmetric effect is fair at common
- Pairs with: [[Mephidross Scavenger]], [[Toxic Reclamation]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Panharmonicon]] (double mill), [[Syr Konrad, the Grim]] (damage from creatures milled), Dredge strategies (enables graveyard), [[Reanimate]] effects (sets up targets)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Limited common with symmetric mill effect.
