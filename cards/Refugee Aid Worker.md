## Image Prompt
> Refugee Aid Worker, Human Cleric from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Tangle — a makeshift refugee camp beneath copper trees. Mood: Genuine hope. Pose: Kneeling to distribute supplies to a tired refugee with visible chrome bone structure. Key visual elements: Simple white robes with copper thread, iron-veined hands offering food, warm light filtering through metallic leaves. Style reference: Rebecca Guay meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Copper, forest green, warm gold light.

## Design Notes
- White 4-drop that creates Citizen tokens
- Fills the 4-CMC gap at common
- Token synergy for go-wide strategies
- Pairs with: [[War Refugee Camp]], [[Sanctuary City Warden]], [[Civilian Militia]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Panharmonicon]] (two tokens), [[Restoration Angel]] (flicker for more tokens), [[Cathars' Crusade]] (counters on ETB), [[Mentor of the Meek]] (draw a card)
- **Potential Combos:** [[Reveillark]] + [[Karmic Guide]] loops (but this has 4 CMC and doesn't enable the combo). Standard blink loops (value but not infinite)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - 4 mana for a 2/4 + 1/1 token (total 3/5 stats across bodies) is fair for common. Compare to [[Inspiring Overseer]] (3 mana 2/1 flying, draw a card, gain 1 life). This is appropriately costed.
