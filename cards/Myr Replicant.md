# Myr Replicant

## Card Type Line
Artifact Creature — Myr

## Rules Text
> When Myr Replicant enters the battlefield, put a replication counter on it.
>
> {3}, Remove a replication counter from Myr Replicant: Create a token that's a copy of Myr Replicant.

## Flavor Text
> *"One becomes two. Two becomes enough."*

## Image Prompt
> Myr Replicant, Myr from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: En-Vidia Lattice — a replication chamber where copies spawn copies. Mood: False promise, exponential growth. Pose: A small chrome Myr standing beside its identical twin, both watching as a third emerges half-formed from a fabrication pod behind them. Key visual elements: Smooth chrome bodies with glowing blue eyes, replication counter visible as a pulsing node on chest, assembly precision in every joint. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Stephan Martiniere. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan replication glow, cold multiplication.

## Design Notes
- Self-replicating Myr for the AI/automation theme
- Counter synergy: Replication counters doubled by [[Hype Cycle]] → exponential growth, [[COMPOUND]] adds fuel
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]] - Myr automation
- Pairs with: [[Myr-Sourced Automation]], [[Simulated Labor Myr]], [[Recursive Self-Improvement]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Myr Galvanizer]] untaps all Myr; [[Clock of Omens]] tap Myr to untap artifacts; Proliferate effects add replication counters
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Doubling Season]] = INFINITE - Each copy enters with 2 counters due to Doubling Season. Pay {3}, remove 1 counter, create a copy with 2 counters. Repeat infinitely for unlimited Myr tokens; [[Panharmonicon]] each token enters with 2 counters (ETB doubled)
- **Balance Assessment:** BROKEN with Doubling Season. Creates infinite Myr because each copy enters with 2 counters. Consider adding "nontoken" to ETB or "Tokens created this way don't trigger this ability"
