# Myr Replicant

## Card Type Line
Artifact Creature — Myr

## Rules Text
> Myr Replicant enters the battlefield with a replication counter on it if it isn't a token.
>
> {3}, Remove a replication counter from Myr Replicant: Create a token that's a copy of Myr Replicant.

## Flavor Text
> *"One becomes two. Two becomes enough."*

## Image Prompt
> Myr Replicant, Myr from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: En-Vidia Lattice — a replication chamber where copies spawn copies. Mood: False promise, exponential growth. Pose: A small chrome Myr standing beside its identical twin, both watching as a third emerges half-formed from a fabrication pod behind them. Key visual elements: Smooth chrome bodies with glowing blue eyes, replication counter visible as a pulsing node on chest, assembly precision in every joint. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Stephan Martiniere. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan replication glow, cold multiplication.

## Design Notes
- Self-replicating Myr for the AI/automation theme
- Counter synergy: Replication counters doubled by [[Hype Cycle]] → exponential growth, [[COMPOUND]] adds fuel
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]] - Myr automation
- Pairs with: [[Myr-Sourced Automation]], [[Simulated Labor Myr]], [[Recursive Self-Improvement]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Myr Galvanizer]] untaps all Myr; [[Clock of Omens]] tap Myr to untap artifacts; Proliferate effects add replication counters
- **Notable Combos:** [[Doubling Season]] doubles counters on non-token original and creates 2 tokens per activation; [[Panharmonicon]] doubles ETB counters on non-token original
- **Balance Assessment:** Fixed - Added "if it isn't a token" clause to prevent infinite loops with Doubling Season. Tokens no longer enter with counters, preventing exponential growth.
