# Silenced Accuser

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Unforged

## Rules Text
> Silenced Accuser enters the battlefield with a spark counter on it.
>
> When Silenced Accuser dies, if it had a spark counter on it, target opponent reveals their hand.

## Flavor Text
> *"She tried to speak. The Synod adjourned."*

## Image Prompt
> Silenced Accuser, Human Unforged from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Seat of the Synod tribunal — cold chrome benches, Synod officials turning away. Mood: Grim determination despite oppression. Pose: Standing restrained with chrome muzzle covering mouth, eyes burning with suppressed truth. Key visual elements: Young face with chrome bone visible at temples, spark counter glowing defiantly in eyes, iron shackles on wrists showing the Unforged's fate. Style reference: Rebecca Guay meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, spark of warm defiant light.

## Design Notes
- 1-drop Unforged with death trigger
- Spark counter requirement for reveal (can be removed to silence)
- Simple common for Unforged tribal
- Tragic flavor of silenced victims
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Unforged (Trafficked Victims)]] - silenced witnesses
- Pairs with: [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]], [[Unforged Witness]], [[Control The Narrative]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Skullclamp]] (draw 2 and reveal opponent's hand), [[Viscera Seer]] (sacrifice for scry + reveal)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - 1/1 for W with conditional death trigger is standard.
