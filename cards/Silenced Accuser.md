# Silenced Accuser

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Unforged

## Rules Text
> Silenced Accuser enters the battlefield with a spark counter on it.
>
> When Silenced Accuser dies, if it had a spark counter on it, target opponent reveals their hand.

## Flavor Text
> *"She tried to speak. The Synod adjourned."*

## Image Prompt
> A young figure with their mouth covered by a chrome muzzle, eyes burning with suppressed truth. Behind them, Synod officials turn away. The spark in their eyes flickers defiantly.

## Design Notes
- 1-drop Unforged with death trigger
- Spark counter requirement for reveal (can be removed to silence)
- Simple common for Unforged tribal
- Tragic flavor of silenced victims
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Unforged (Trafficked Victims)]] - silenced witnesses
- Pairs with: [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]], [[Unforged Witness]], [[Control The Narrative]]
