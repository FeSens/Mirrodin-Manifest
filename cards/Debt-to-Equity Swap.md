# Debt-to-Equity Swap

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Target opponent sacrifices each Debt they control. For each Debt sacrificed this way, you draw a card and that player creates a 1/1 colorless Myr artifact creature token.

## Flavor Text
> *"Your debt becomes our property."*

## Image Prompt
> Debt-to-Equity Swap — Instant. Action depicted: A blue-robed financier transmuting a pile of debt contracts into emerging Myr workers. Setting: Seat of the Synod/En-Vidia Lattice — financial conversion chamber. Focal point: The moment contracts become chrome Myr bodies. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: Steel blue robes, chrome Myr, red-to-silver contract transformation.

## Design Notes
- Blue rare instant
- Converts opponent's debt into your card advantage
- Opponent gets Myr tokens (mixed blessing - clears debt but gives you cards)
- Financial jargon flavor (debt-to-equity swaps are real financial instruments)
- Interesting political play in multiplayer
- Pairs with: [[Myr Repo Unit]], [[Economic Warfare]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Illness in the Ranks]] / [[Virulent Plague]] (kill the Myr tokens they get), [[Suture Priest]] (drain for each Myr created), Debt Ceiling (opponent has more Debts = more cards for you)
- **Potential Combos:** With Default Cascade on the field: Opponent sacrifices Debts, creates more (with Debt Ceiling: lots more). This is value, not broken.
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Card advantage requires setup. Giving opponent tokens is real downside.
