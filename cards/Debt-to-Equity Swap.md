# Debt-to-Equity Swap

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Target opponent sacrifices all [[Debt Token|Debt tokens]] they control. For each Debt token sacrificed this way, you draw a card and that player creates a 1/1 colorless Myr artifact creature token.

## Flavor Text
> *"Your debt becomes our property."*

## Image Prompt
> A blue-robed financier converting a pile of debt contracts into a small army of Myr workers. The debtor loses their obligations but also loses their freedom, becoming a worker in someone else's empire. Corporate takeover, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- Blue rare instant
- Converts opponent's debt into your card advantage
- Opponent gets Myr tokens (mixed blessing - clears debt but gives you cards)
- Financial jargon flavor (debt-to-equity swaps are real financial instruments)
- Interesting political play in multiplayer
- Pairs with: [[Myr Repo Unit]], [[Economic Warfare]]
