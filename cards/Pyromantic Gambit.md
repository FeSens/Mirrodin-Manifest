# Pyromantic Gambit

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Gamble X times. Pyromantic Gambit deals damage to any target equal to twice the number of gambles you won this way.

## Flavor Text
> *"More dice, more fire, more chaos. What's not to love?"*

## Image Prompt
> A pyromancer surrounded by a storm of flaming dice, each roll adding to a growing inferno. The more they gamble, the bigger the blast.

## Design Notes
- Red rare sorcery - addresses Red rare gap (-10)
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] synergy - X-spell with gambling
- Expected value: X gambles = X wins = 2X damage
- With [[The House Edge]]: X gambles = X wins (almost) = 2X damage guaranteed
- Pairs with [[Chaos Theorist]], [[Glimmervoid High Roller]]
- High variance, high reward - core Red philosophy

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Krark's Thumb]] with 75% win rate, X=5 averages ~7.5 wins = 15 damage; [[Chance Encounter]] adds luck counter per win; [[Fiery Emancipation]]/[[Dictate of the Twin Gods]] damage doublers make this devastating
- **Potential Combos:** [[Krark's Thumb]] + X=10 - expected ~7.5 wins = 15 damage, likely one-shots opponents; [[Mana Geyser]] + Big X in multiplayer for massive mana into lethal gambit; [[Reiterate]]/[[Fork]] effects copy for additional damage
- **Balance Assessment:** Balanced by variance - without Krark's Thumb, expected damage is just X
