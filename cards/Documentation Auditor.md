# Documentation Auditor

## Card Type Line
Creature — Vedalken Advisor Mer-Ikan

## Rules Text
> Creatures that weren't cast from their owner's hand enter the battlefield tapped and don't untap during their controller's next untap step.
>
> {W}{U}, {T}: Exile target creature that entered the battlefield this turn and wasn't cast from its owner's hand.

## Flavor Text
> *"Your documentation has... irregularities."*

## Image Prompt
> A Vedalken in official robes examining documents with a magnifying lens, red stamps of rejection scattered across their desk. Bureaucratic precision.

## Design Notes
- Slows illegal entry (tap + skip untap)
- Targeted exile for "undocumented" creatures
- Azorius deportation bureaucracy
- Mer-Ikan faction enforcer
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - documentation requirements
- Pairs with: [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[Foundry Checkpoint Officer]], [[Foundry Citizenship]]
