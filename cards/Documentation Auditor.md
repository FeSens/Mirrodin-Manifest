# Documentation Auditor

## Card Type Line
Creature — Vedalken Advisor Mer-Ikan

## Rules Text
> Creatures that weren't cast from their owner's hand enter the battlefield tapped and don't untap during their controller's next untap step.
>
> {W}{U}, {T}: Exile target creature that entered the battlefield this turn and wasn't cast from its owner's hand.

## Flavor Text
> *"Your documentation has... irregularities."*

## Image Prompt
> Documentation Auditor, Vedalken Advisor Mer-Ikan from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Seat of the Synod/Mer-Ikan border processing — document review station. Mood: Suspicion. Pose: Hunched over desk, examining documents through magnifying lens, stamp poised. Key visual elements: Chrome-boned fingers holding lens, iron-veined stern face, red rejection stamps scattered across desk. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: White robes, steel blue skin, red stamps, chrome desk.

## Design Notes
- Slows illegal entry (tap + skip untap)
- Targeted exile for "undocumented" creatures
- Azorius deportation bureaucracy
- Mer-Ikan faction enforcer
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - documentation requirements
- Pairs with: [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[Foundry Checkpoint Officer]], [[Foundry Citizenship]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Torpor Orb]] (shuts down ETB creatures entirely), [[Hushwing Gryff]] (similar stax), Devastating hoser vs. reanimation strategies
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** Hard counters reanimation entirely - Creatures reanimated enter tapped, skip untap, can be exiled. Vs. token strategies - All tokens (created, not cast) enter tapped and skip untap.
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN as a hoser - This completely shuts down reanimation strategies, token strategies, blink strategies, Sneak Attack strategies, Through the Breach, Show and Tell, Natural Order, etc. For 3 mana. This is comparable to Containment Priest but with added "don't untap" and targeted exile. Recommend making it 4 mana or removing the "don't untap" clause - currently too strong as a universal hoser.
