# Mak-Ron, the Glass Orator

## Card Type Line
Legendary Creature — Vedalken Advisor

## Rules Text
> At the beginning of your upkeep, scry 2.
>
> {U}, {T}: Choose one —
> • Redistribute. *(Choose two permanents. Remove all counters from them, then each gets half that many counters, rounded down.)*
> • Each player draws a card.
>
> *"Integration requires... adjustment."*

## Flavor Text
> *"His speeches promise everything. The Quicksilver Sea evaporates regardless."*

## Image Prompt
> Mak-Ron, the Glass Orator, Vedalken Advisor from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Seat of the Synod — a crystal podium overlooking the Quicksilver Sea, which visibly recedes behind him. Mood: False promise, eloquent misdirection. Pose: Standing tall with arms spread wide in grand oratory gesture, audience nodding unaware of the disaster behind them. Key visual elements: Pristine white robes on blue Vedalken skin, chrome-threaded hair perfectly styled, silver tongue literally visible, the sea draining away unnoticed. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, pristine white, quicksilver receding, subtle doom.

## Design Notes
- Mak-Ron from [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - Macron allegory
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] on command (forced equality politics)
- Or group draw (diplomatic negotiation)
- Scry for "calculated" speeches
- Scry 2 each upkeep synergizes with [[🎲 GAMBLE]] (information advantage)
- Pairs with: [[Synod High Chancellor]], [[Hype Cycle]], [[Austerity Minister]], [[Opposition Leader]], [[The House Edge]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Smothering Tithe]] (opponent's draws become your Treasures), [[Notion Thief]] / [[Narset, Parter of Veils]] (if you "each player draws" with these out, only you draw), [[Psychic Possession]] (draw when opponents draw), [[Propaganda]] / [[Ghostly Prison]] (defensive while accruing value)
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** With [[Notion Thief]], "Each player draws" becomes completely one-sided card advantage.
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - 4 mana 2/4 with activated abilities is reasonable. The group draw mode with Notion Thief is a known interaction pattern in MTG design space.
