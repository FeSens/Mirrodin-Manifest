# Hallucination Engine

## Card Type Line
Artifact Creature — Construct

## Rules Text
> Whenever you scry, put a glitch counter on Hallucination Engine.
>
> {T}, Remove three glitch counters from Hallucination Engine: Create a token that's a copy of target creature. Sacrifice it at the beginning of the next end step.

## Flavor Text
> *"It looks real. It acts real. It isn't."*

## Image Prompt
> Hallucination Engine — Artifact Creature Construct. Visual focus: A chrome machine with crystalline projector arrays generating a flickering holographic warrior, the duplicate glitching at the edges with static and distortion, incomplete projections hovering like ghosts. Setting: The Seat of the Synod, a data processing chamber. Mood: Institutional horror, false promise. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan glitch-light, flickering whites.

## Design Notes
- Represents AI hallucinations/confabulations
- Scry triggers (common in set) build glitch counters
- Temporary copies = hallucinations that fade
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles glitch counters for more hallucinations, [[COMPOUND]] adds
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Great Doubt (The AI Hype Correction)]] - AI unreliability
- Scry triggers synergize with [[🎲 GAMBLE]] (scry before gambling)
- Pairs with: [[Sal-Tman, Prophet of the Core-Logic]], [[Trough of Disillusionment]], [[The Vibe Shift]], [[The House Edge]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Sensei's Divining Top]] (scry every turn = counters every turn), [[Thassa, God of the Sea]] (free scry each upkeep), [[Preordain]]/[[Serum Visions]] (multiple scry triggers), [[The Reality Chip]] (continuous card advantage + scry)
- **Potential Combos:** [[Thousand-Year Elixir]] + lots of scry - Multiple activations per turn. [[Aphetto Alchemist]] - Untap to use multiple times. Copy [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]] or [[Splinter Twin]] target - The copy can make more copies before EOT sacrifice.
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Requires significant scry investment. Three scry triggers for one temporary creature is reasonable.
