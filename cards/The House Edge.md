# The House Edge

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> Whenever you gamble, scry 1 before revealing cards.

## Flavor Text
> *"The odds aren't in your favor. They're in mine. I built the table."*
> — Kha-Sino, Glimmervoid Broker

## Image Prompt
> The House Edge — Enchantment. Visual focus: A shadowy dealer behind a chrome gambling table, secretly manipulating the game. Setting: Glimmervoid casino — opulent golden chamber with rigged tables. Focal point: Dealer's hand subtly manipulating cards, table surface reflecting everything, knowing smile in shadow. Mood: False promise. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Warm gold lighting, shadow black, chrome table surface.

## Design Notes
- **Mechanic synergy:** The GAMBLE mechanic notes explicitly state "Scry before Gamble is extremely strong" and "Knowledge (scry) = market manipulation"
- This card represents the casino always having an edge—you know what's coming
- At 2 mana, it's an early investment that pays off every gamble for the rest of the game
- Blue is the color of manipulation, information, and "cheating fair"
- The scry lets you either keep a high mana value card on top (to win) or bottom a low one (to improve odds)
- **Lore connection:** The Glimmervoid is home to the gold rally and high-stakes dealings; this is where the brokers rig the game
- Kha-Sino (casino) is a new character—a Glimmervoid dealer who runs crooked tables
- Pairs with: [[🎲 GAMBLE]], [[Gambling with the Devil]], [[Glimmervoid Broker]], [[Hedge Fund Manager]], [[The Rigged Game]]
- **Balance note:** Rare because it fundamentally changes the gamble dynamic; you're no longer gambling, you're just winning
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Glimmervoid Rally (Gold Rally)]] - rigged financial systems

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Any Gamble card in the set, [[Sensei's Divining Top]], [[Sylvan Library]]
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** Turns all Gamble mechanics into guaranteed wins with scry manipulation
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Build-around rare that requires Gamble synergy
