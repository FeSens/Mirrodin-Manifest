## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> Whenever you win a gamble, create a Gold token. *(To gamble, you and target opponent reveal the top card of your libraries. Whoever reveals the card with greater mana value wins.)*

## Flavor Text
> *"Win or lose, the house always profits."*

## Image Prompt
> Fortune's Favor — Enchantment. Visual focus: A grinning Leonin dealer at casino table, gold tokens piling on one side, flames erupting on the other — every outcome benefits the house. Setting: Glimmervoid casino — the heart of gambling. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Gold tokens, furnace orange flames, chrome table, white bright lights.

## Design Notes
- **Gamble payoff hub** - rewards BOTH winning AND losing
- Connects ALL gamble cards: [[All-In Gambler]], [[Gambling with the Devil]], [[Lucky Strike]], [[Jackpot Wurm]], [[Reckless Wager]], [[Wild Growth Gambit]], [[Pyromantic Gambit]], [[Flames of Fortune]], [[Gamble with Fate]], [[Gambler's Instinct]]
- Creates [[Gold Token]] synergy with [[Hedge]], [[Hedge Fund Manager]], [[Aurum Standard]]
- Draw + damage = Red gets value either way
- Pairs with [[The House Edge]] (guaranteed wins = guaranteed draws)
- Pairs with [[Den of Chance]] location

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Krark, the Thumbless]] (coin flip synergy commander), [[Tavern Scoundrel]] (coin flip treasure generation), [[Chance Encounter]] (coin flip win condition), [[Frenetic Efreet]] (repeated coin flips)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Both outcomes are good for you, which is strong, but requires other gamble cards to trigger.
