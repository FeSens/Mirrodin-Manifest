# Inflation Hedge

## Card Type Line
Artifact

## Rules Text
> Whenever a Debt token enters the battlefield under an opponent's control, create a Gold token.
>
> Sacrifice Inflation Hedge: Destroy all Debt tokens.

## Flavor Text
> *"When paper fails, gold endures."*

## Image Prompt
> Inflation Hedge — Artifact. Visual focus: A golden vault with reinforced chrome doors, glowing brighter as crumbling debt contracts and failing currency notes pile up around its base, gold multiplying within. Setting: The Glimmervoid, financial district ruins. Mood: False promise, sanctuary amid collapse. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Gold, white, crumbling grey paper, copper reinforcement.

## Design Notes
- Selesnya rare artifact
- [[Gold Token]] synergy
- Creates Gold when opponents get Debt (profiting from their misfortune)
- Emergency debt destruction on sacrifice
- [[Lore]] connection: gold rally, hedging against collapse
- Pairs with: [[Gold Token]], [[Hedge Fund Manager]], [[Vault of the Liquid Sun]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Cards that give opponents Debt (convert their punishment to your advantage), [[Smothering Tithe]] (similar "opponent does thing, you benefit" designs)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Set-specific hoser/payoff. Depends on Debt token prevalence.
