# Austerity Minister

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Cleric

## Rules Text
> At the beginning of your upkeep, you may remove a counter from a permanent you control.

## Flavor Text
> *"The deficit must be addressed. Your counters will suffice."*

## Image Prompt
> Austerity Minister, Human Cleric from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Mer-Ikan Foundry — austere government chamber with citizens lined up. Mood: Institutional horror. Pose: Reaching toward a citizen's possession, plucking a golden counter with spindly fingers. Key visual elements: Gaunt face with chrome cheekbones, severe black and white robes, pockets bulging with collected counters. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Stark black and white, gold counter accents.

## Design Notes
- Slowly drains counters from your permanents
- Anti-synergy with counter strategies - counters [[COMPOUND]] and [[Hype Cycle]]
- Gains life from others' losses
- Economic austerity made manifest
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Great Doubt (The AI Hype Correction)]] - fiscal conservatism
- Pairs with: [[Market Crash]], [[Trickle-Down Theorist]], [[Mak-Ron, the Glass Orator]]
- **Restriction added:** Changed to optional "you may" trigger on YOUR upkeep only, preventing infinite persist combos where mandatory counter removal enables endless Kitchen Finks/Glen Elendra Archmage loops with sac outlets

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Chisei, Heart of Oceans]] stacks counter removal; [[Power Conduit]] move counters before removal; [[Solemnity]] prevents new counters
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Persist creatures]] ([[Kitchen Finks]], [[Glen Elendra Archmage]]) + sac outlet = infinite loops. Remove -1/-1 counter each upkeep, sacrifice, persist back; [[Devoted Druid]] removes -1/-1 counters for extra mana
- **Balance Assessment:** FIXED - Changed to optional "you may" trigger on your upkeep only, preventing forced persist combo loops
