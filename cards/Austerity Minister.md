# Austerity Minister

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Cleric

## Rules Text
> At the beginning of each player's upkeep, that player removes a counter from a permanent they control.
>
> Whenever a counter is removed from a permanent an opponent controls, you gain 1 life.
>
> *"Tighten your belts. Sacrifice is virtue."*

## Flavor Text
> *"The deficit must be addressed. Your counters will suffice."*

## Image Prompt
> A gaunt figure in severe black and white robes, removing golden counters from poor citizens' belongings. They pocket each one. Austerity for thee.

## Design Notes
- Slowly drains counters from everyone
- Anti-synergy with counter strategies - counters [[COMPOUND]] and [[Hype Cycle]]
- Gains life from others' losses
- Economic austerity made manifest
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Great Doubt (The AI Hype Correction)]] - fiscal conservatism
- Pairs with: [[Market Crash]], [[Trickle-Down Theorist]], [[Mak-Ron, the Glass Orator]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Chisei, Heart of Oceans]] stacks counter removal; [[Power Conduit]] move counters before removal; [[Solemnity]] prevents new counters
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Persist creatures]] ([[Kitchen Finks]], [[Glen Elendra Archmage]]) + sac outlet = infinite loops. Remove -1/-1 counter each upkeep, sacrifice, persist back; [[Devoted Druid]] removes -1/-1 counters for extra mana
- **Balance Assessment:** BROKEN - Forced counter removal each upkeep enables infinite persist combos. Consider "nontoken permanent" or "you may remove a counter"
