## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> Whenever you win a gamble, Flames of Fortune deals 2 damage to any target.

## Flavor Text
> *"Luck burns bright. Failure burns you."*

## Image Prompt
> Flames of Fortune — Enchantment. Visual focus: A brazier of chaotic fire, flames leaping higher with each visible dice roll, licking at both enemies and caster. Setting: Glimmervoid gambling hall — fire at the heart of fortune. Mood: Buried rage. Style reference: Seb McKinnon meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Gold brazier, orange-red chaotic flames, amber dice glow.

## Design Notes
- Red uncommon enchantment - addresses Red uncommon gap (-10)
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] synergy - persistent gamble payoff
- Win = 2 damage to opponent, Lose = 1 damage to you
- Net positive expected value for gamblers
- Pairs with [[Chaos Theorist]], [[The House Edge]]
- Red's angle: aggression through gambling

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Krark's Thumb]] gives 75% win rate making this a reliable damage engine; [[Chance Encounter]] adds luck counter while dealing damage; [[Fiery Emancipation]] triples the 2 damage to 6 per won gamble
- **Potential Combos:** [[Krark, the Thumbless]] + cheap instants - each cast triggers coin flips, dealing 2 repeatedly; [[Dictate of the Twin Gods]]/[[Furnace of Rath]] doubles the 2 damage to 4; [[Ral Zarek]] ultimate creates multiple coin flips for machine-gun damage
- **Balance Assessment:** Reasonably balanced - self-damage on losses provides real downside
