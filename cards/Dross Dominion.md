# Dross Dominion

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> Zombie creatures you control get +1/+0 and have deathtouch.
>
> Whenever a nontoken creature dies, you may pay {B}. If you do, create a 2/2 black Zombie creature token.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Mephidross claims all. In death, you serve the Dross."*

## Image Prompt
> Dross Dominion — Enchantment. Visual focus: The toxic swamps of Mephidross given form, zombies emerging endlessly from necrogen muck. Setting: Vault of Whispers/Dross Dominion — the heart of undeath. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: Near-black swamp, dark olive muck, sickly necrogen glow on emerging zombies.

## Design Notes
- **Zombie/Dross tribal hub** - connects Mephidross cards
- Connects: [[Dross Executioner]], [[Dross Harvester]], [[Mephidross Scavenger]], [[Mephidross Refugee]], [[Rusted Nim Conscript]], [[Nim Occupation Force]]
- Death trigger creates zombie army
- Graveyard synergy with exile-to-draw
- Lore connection: [[Lore#Put-In, the Iron Despot]] - the endless Nim legions
- Pairs with: [[Put-In, the Iron Despot]], [[Soul Extraction]], [[Spark Harvester]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Gravecrawler]] (self-recurring Zombie enables repeated death triggers), [[Phyrexian Altar]] (sacrifice Zombies for mana, creating more Zombies), [[Blood Artist]] / [[Zulaport Cutthroat]] (drain on each death trigger), [[Chatterfang, Squirrel General]] (creates additional tokens on each Zombie creation)
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Gravecrawler]] + [[Phyrexian Altar]] + Dross Dominion = Infinite loop. Sacrifice Gravecrawler (generates {B}), pay {B} to create Zombie, cast Gravecrawler from graveyard for {B}. Net neutral on mana but infinite death triggers with [[Blood Artist]] wins the game.
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN - The combination with Gravecrawler and Phyrexian Altar creates a deterministic infinite combo. The card itself is costed appropriately, but the death trigger with no limitation (any creature, not just yours) at instant-speed activation makes this very strong. Consider adding "nontoken creature" to the death trigger.
