## Image Prompt
> Reprocessing Agent, Golem Mer-Ikan from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Mer-Ikan Foundry checkpoint — darksteel barriers, The Great Furnace glowing behind. Mood: Institutional horror. Pose: Standing rigid at checkpoint, scanner in one hand, restraining clamps formed from the other. Key visual elements: Militaristic chrome armor with Foundry insignia, long line of frightened creatures with visible metal bone structures waiting to be processed, harsh white spotlights. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Stark white, silver, furnace glow.

## Design Notes
- Mechanic: Temporary exile with lasting trauma
- **Counter synergy:** Returned creatures get -1/-1 counters (processing leaves marks)
- [[Hype Cycle]] doubles those -1/-1 counters if they're still there
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] can spread the trauma to other creatures
- Creature type Mer-Ikan establishes the faction
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - The Mer-Ikan Foundry's enforcement arm
- White fits the "law and order" flavor, even when unjust

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Flickerwisp]] / [[Restoration Angel]] (blink to repeatedly exile and debuff creatures), [[Panharmonicon]] (double exile triggers), [[Skullclamp]] (drawing cards from debuffed 1/1s that return), [[Solemnity]] (prevents -1/-1 counters on YOUR creatures, but opponents still get debuffed)
- **Potential Combos:** [[Thassa, Deep-Dwelling]] + Reprocessing Agent (repeated exile every end step, stacking -1/-1 counters on returned creatures)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - The MV 3 or less restriction is meaningful. Similar to existing Banisher Priest variants with added debuff.
