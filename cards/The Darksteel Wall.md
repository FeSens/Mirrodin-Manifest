# The Darksteel Wall

## Card Type Line
Legendary Artifact

## Rules Text
> Indestructible
>
> Creatures your opponents control that weren't cast can't attack.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Mephidross will pay for it. One extracted ore at a time."*
> — Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel

## Image Prompt
> The Darksteel Wall — Legendary Artifact. Visual focus: A colossal indestructible wall of seamless darksteel stretching across the horizon. Setting: Border between the Great Furnace and Mephidross — gleaming territory versus toxic swamps. Focal point: Tromp's gilded silhouette atop a watchtower, desperate figures clawing at the base. Mood: Institutional horror. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets John Avon. Color palette: Metallic silver wall, sickly green Mephidross, gold of Tromp's armor.

## Design Notes
- Indestructible fits darksteel flavor and the "unbreakable wall" narrative
- **Counter synergy:** Construction counters grow each turn, [[Hype Cycle]] doubles them
- [[Compound]] accelerates construction, [[Market Crash]] tears it down
- Life drain is flat 2 (was scaling — simplified for fun)
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - Tromp's signature project, always under construction
- Mythic rare power level for a build-around
