# The Darksteel Wall

## Card Type Line
Legendary Artifact

## Rules Text
> Indestructible
>
> The Darksteel Wall enters the battlefield with three construction counters on it.
>
> Creatures entering the battlefield under opponents' control enter tapped unless The Darksteel Wall has fewer than three construction counters.
>
> Creatures your opponents control that weren't cast from their hand can't attack if The Darksteel Wall has three or more construction counters.
>
> At the beginning of your upkeep, put a construction counter on The Darksteel Wall. Each opponent who controls a creature that wasn't cast from their hand loses 1 life for each construction counter on The Darksteel Wall.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Mephidross will pay for it. One extracted ore at a time."*
> — Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel

## Image Prompt
> The Darksteel Wall — Legendary Artifact. Visual focus: A colossal indestructible wall of seamless darksteel stretching across the horizon. Setting: Border between the Great Furnace and Mephidross — gleaming territory versus toxic swamps. Focal point: Tromp's gilded silhouette atop a watchtower, desperate figures clawing at the base. Mood: Institutional horror. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets John Avon. Color palette: Metallic silver wall, sickly green Mephidross, gold of Tromp's armor.

## Design Notes
- Indestructible fits darksteel flavor and the "unbreakable wall" narrative
- **Counter synergy:** Construction counters grow each turn, [[Hype Cycle]] doubles them
- [[Compound]] accelerates construction, [[Market Crash]] tears it down
- Life drain scales with construction progress
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - Tromp's signature project, always under construction
- Mythic rare power level for a build-around
