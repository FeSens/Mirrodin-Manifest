# The Darksteel Wall

## Card Type Line
Legendary Artifact

## Rules Text
> Indestructible
>
> The Darksteel Wall enters the battlefield with three construction counters on it.
>
> Creatures entering the battlefield under opponents' control enter tapped unless The Darksteel Wall has fewer than three construction counters.
>
> Creatures your opponents control that weren't cast from their hand can't attack if The Darksteel Wall has three or more construction counters.
>
> At the beginning of your upkeep, put a construction counter on The Darksteel Wall. Each opponent who controls a creature that wasn't cast from their hand loses 1 life for each construction counter on The Darksteel Wall.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Mephidross will pay for it. One extracted ore at a time."*
> — Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel

## Image Prompt
> A colossal wall of seamless darksteel stretching across the horizon, separating the gleaming Great Furnace territory from the toxic swamps of the Mephidross. Desperate figures claw at the base while armored Mer-Ikan sentries patrol the top. Tromp's gilded silhouette stands atop a watchtower. Metallic silver wall contrasting with sickly green Mephidross atmosphere. Epic scale, MTG card art style, imposing and oppressive.

## Design Notes
- Indestructible fits darksteel flavor and the "unbreakable wall" narrative
- **Counter synergy:** Construction counters grow each turn, [[Hype Cycle]] doubles them
- [[Compound]] accelerates construction, [[Market Crash]] tears it down
- Life drain scales with construction progress
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - Tromp's signature project, always under construction
- Mythic rare power level for a build-around
