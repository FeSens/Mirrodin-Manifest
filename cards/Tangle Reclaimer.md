# Tangle Reclaimer

## Card Type Line
Creature — Beast

## Rules Text
> Trample
>
> When Tangle Reclaimer enters the battlefield, choose two target permanents you control. Redistribute them. Then put two +1/+1 counters on Tangle Reclaimer.
>
> *(To redistribute, remove all counters from them, then each gets half that many counters, rounded down.)*

## Flavor Text
> *"The Tangle takes back what was scattered."*

## Image Prompt
> Tangle Reclaimer, Beast from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Tangle — deep forest where discarded metal accumulates. Mood: Grim determination. Pose: Absorbing energy from surrounding creatures, growing larger. Key visual elements: Massive form of reclaimed chrome and copper vines, glowing counters flowing into its body, smaller creatures giving strength willingly. Style reference: Seb McKinnon meets Rebecca Guay. Color palette: Copper, forest green, glowing counter light.

## Design Notes
- Green rare creature - addresses Green rare gap (-10, critical!)
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] synergy - Green uses Redistribute to grow
- Unique angle: Redistribute as growth, not punishment
- Trample makes the counters matter
- Pairs with [[COMPOUND]], [[Hype Cycle]] (counters can be doubled after)
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - The Tangle reclaiming resources

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Hardened Scales]]/[[Branching Evolution]] extra counters per redistribution; [[The Ozolith]] stores counters, redistribute, regain counters; [[Doubling Season]] doubles all counters placed during redistribution
- **Potential Combos:** [[Walking Ballista]]/[[Hangarback Walker]] move counters to Reclaimer for a massive beater; Modular creatures - redistribute modular counters for value; Hydra creatures with many counters - strip their counters to grow Reclaimer
- **Balance Assessment:** Balanced - 5 mana 5/5 trample, only targets your permanents, ETB only
