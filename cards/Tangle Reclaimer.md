# Tangle Reclaimer

## Card Type Line
Creature — Beast

## Rules Text
> Trample
>
> When Tangle Reclaimer enters the battlefield, redistribute among up to two target permanents you control. For each counter redistributed this way, put a +1/+1 counter on Tangle Reclaimer.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Tangle takes back what was scattered."*

## Image Prompt
> A massive beast made of reclaimed metal and vines, absorbing discarded counters from smaller creatures. It grows with each redistribution.

## Design Notes
- Green rare creature - addresses Green rare gap (-10, critical!)
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] synergy - Green uses Redistribute to grow
- Unique angle: Redistribute as growth, not punishment
- Trample makes the counters matter
- Pairs with [[COMPOUND]], [[Hype Cycle]] (counters can be doubled after)
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - The Tangle reclaiming resources

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Hardened Scales]]/[[Branching Evolution]] extra counters per redistribution; [[The Ozolith]] stores counters, redistribute, regain counters; [[Doubling Season]] doubles all counters placed during redistribution
- **Potential Combos:** [[Walking Ballista]]/[[Hangarback Walker]] move counters to Reclaimer for a massive beater; Modular creatures - redistribute modular counters for value; Hydra creatures with many counters - strip their counters to grow Reclaimer
- **Balance Assessment:** Balanced - 5 mana 5/5 trample, only targets your permanents, ETB only
