# Debt Accumulator

## Card Type Line
Creature — Vedalken Wizard

## Rules Text
> {T}: Put a debt counter on target [[Debt Token|Debt token]].

## Flavor Text
> *"Time is money. Specifically, your money."*

## Image Prompt
> Debt Accumulator, Vedalken Wizard from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Seat of the Synod/En-Vidia Lattice — financial calculation chamber. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Pose: Standing with arms raised, manipulating floating abacus of debt. Key visual elements: Chrome-boned fingers, iron-veined skin, holographic debt contracts swirling. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, red debt markers.

## Design Notes
- Blue common creature
- Active debt increase (more damage when it comes due)
- Can target your own or opponent's Debt
- Defensive 1/3 body
- Addresses Blue common gap
- Pairs with: [[Credit Default]], [[Economic Warfare]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Thousand-Year Elixir]] / [[Lightning Greaves]] (immediate activation), [[Pemmin's Aura]] / [[Freed from the Real]] (multiple activations per turn), Debt Ceiling (Debts already have 3 counters; adding more is devastating)
- **Potential Combos:** With [[Freed from the Real]] + any mana-positive artifact: Infinite debt counter additions (but requires opponent to have Debt tokens)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Requires Debt tokens to exist. Scaling damage is the intended design.
