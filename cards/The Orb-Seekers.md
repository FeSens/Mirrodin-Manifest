# The Orb-Seekers

## Card Type Line
Creature — Construct

## Rules Text
> When The Orb-Seekers enters, each player reveals their hand. For each player, exile a nonland card from their hand face-down. You may look at cards exiled this way.
>
> {2}, {T}: Target player draws a card. Put a +1/+1 counter on The Orb-Seekers.
>
> When The Orb-Seekers leaves the battlefield, each player puts the cards they own exiled with it into their graveyard.
>
> *"Your identity, in exchange for prosperity."*

## Power/Toughness
> 2/4

## Flavor Text
> *They promised universal income. They delivered universal surveillance.*

## Image Prompt
> Spherical chrome constructs with a single glowing blue "eye" moving through a crowded Mirrodin marketplace. Beings line up to stare into the orbs, which scan their faces with pale light. Some receive small tokens of payment; all receive a mark that glows faintly on their foreheads afterward. The constructs grow larger with each scan, their chassis expanding. Clinical yet invasive, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Worldcoin, Sam Altman's iris-scanning crypto project promising universal basic income
- **Lore:** Constructs that harvest "spark-signatures" (biometric data) in exchange for small payments
- The ETB exiles cards face-down—you take their data/identity
- The activated ability gives them something small (draw) while you grow stronger (+1/+1)
- When it leaves, the data goes to the graveyard—compromised, not returned safely
- White/Blue for surveillance dressed as benevolence
- Pairs with: [[Sal-Tman, Prophet of the Core-Logic]], [[Protocol Monopoly]]
