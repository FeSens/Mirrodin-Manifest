## Image Prompt
> The Orb-Seekers, Construct from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Glimmervoid marketplace — crowded commerce hub. Mood: False promise. Pose: Spherical chrome constructs floating through crowds, scanning faces. Key visual elements: Single glowing blue eye per orb, beings lining up to be scanned, small payment tokens exchanged, faint marks appearing on foreheads, constructs growing larger. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Chrome spheres, pale scanning light, Glimmervoid gold accents.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Worldcoin, Sam Altman's iris-scanning crypto project promising universal basic income
- **Lore:** Constructs that harvest "spark-signatures" (biometric data) in exchange for small payments
- The ETB exiles cards face-down—you take their data/identity
- The activated ability gives them something small (draw) while you grow stronger (+1/+1)
- When it leaves, the data goes to the graveyard—compromised, not returned safely
- White/Blue for surveillance dressed as benevolence
- Pairs with: [[Sal-Tman, Prophet of the Core-Logic]], [[Protocol Monopoly]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Flicker effects ([[Restoration Angel]], [[Thassa, Deep-Dwelling]]), proliferate for +1/+1 counters
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** ETB exile is powerful hand disruption; repeated flickering locks out opponent's best cards
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - 5 mana with reasonable effects
