## Image Prompt
> Lattice Blackout — Instant. Action depicted: A bird's-eye view of the Seat of the Synod going dark sector by sector, Lattice nodes flickering and dying in sequence, Myr collapsing mid-stride with eyes going black, defense turrets powering down. Setting: The En-Vidia Lattice network, spreading blackout wave. Focal point: The cascading darkness, the approaching Foundry aircraft lights on the horizon. Mood: Institutional horror, technological devastation. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Steel blue fading to black, chrome going dark, cyan glitch-patterns.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** U.S. Cyber Command blacked out Caracas before the raid; Trump stated "the city was largely blacked out ahead of the raid due to a certain expertise that we have"
- **Lore adaptation:** The Mer-Ikan Foundry using the En-Vidia Lattice against itself—hacking infrastructure
- Tapping artifacts and creatures represents disabling defenses and communications
- "Don't untap" represents sustained disruption
- Drawing a card represents intelligence gathering during the chaos
- The quote is adapted directly from Trump's statement about the operation
- Blue/Black represents the cyber warfare and covert nature
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - cyber warfare capabilities
- Pairs with: [[Operation Absolute Resolve]], [[Foundry Strike Team]], [[En-Vidia Processing Core]], [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Stasis]] (extended lockdown), [[Frozen Aether]] / [[Kismet]] (further slow opponents), [[Opposition]] (combined tap effects)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Comparable to Sleep with different targeting. The cantrip makes it strong but not broken at 3 CMC in two colors.
