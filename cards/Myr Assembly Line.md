# Myr Assembly Line

## Card Type Line
Artifact

## Rules Text
> {T}: Create a 1/1 colorless Myr artifact creature token. Activate only as a sorcery.

## Flavor Text
> *"Efficiency is measured in units produced, not lives replaced."*

## Image Prompt
> Myr Assembly Line — Artifact. Visual focus: An endless conveyor system producing identical Myr units, each emerging from fabrication chambers in perfect sequence. Setting: En-Vidia Lattice industrial core. Mood: Institutional horror, cold efficiency. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Stephan Martiniere. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan assembly lights, endless repetition into darkness.

## Design Notes
- Colorless uncommon for Myr tribal
- Repeatable token generation
- Sorcery speed balances power
- Pairs with: [[Myr Replicant]], [[Simulated Labor Myr]], [[The Myr Collective]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Intruder Alarm]] (won't go infinite alone due to sorcery restriction), [[Doubling Season]] / [[Parallel Lives]] (double tokens), [[Clock of Omens]] (untap for more activations but not infinite without more pieces), [[Krark-Clan Ironworks]] (sacrifice Myr for mana)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - The sorcery-speed restriction is key. Without it, this would be broken with Intruder Alarm. As-is, it's appropriately powered.
