# Protocol Enforcer

## Card Type Line
Creature — Vedalken Soldier

## Rules Text
> Flying
>
> {T}: Tap target creature.

## Flavor Text
> *"Compliance is not optional."*

## Image Prompt
> Protocol Enforcer, Vedalken Soldier from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Seat of the Synod — hovering above a civilian crowd in a public plaza. Mood: Institutional horror, cold authority. Pose: Floating on anti-grav wings, arm extended with chrome finger pointing at a dissenter frozen mid-protest. Key visual elements: Stern blue Vedalken features, chrome flight armor, the targeted citizen locked in place by visible blue energy binding. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan enforcement energy, crowd grays below.

## Design Notes
- Blue common creature - addresses Blue common gap (-4)
- Flying plus tap ability for common evasion/control
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Synod of Cognitive Accord]]
- Pairs with: [[Freeze Protocol]], [[Lattice Overseer]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Opposition]] (another tapper for the lock), [[Derevi, Empyrial Tactician]] (untap to tap repeatedly), [[Reconnaissance Mission]] (flying creature that deals damage draws cards), [[Edric, Spymaster of Trest]] (evasive creature for draw)
- **Potential Combos:** [[Pemmin's Aura]] / [[Freed from the Real]] (infinite untaps, but need to tap things for value). With [[Winter Orb]] (keep opponent locked while you untap flyers)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - 4 mana for a 2/4 flyer with tap ability is reasonably costed (compare to [[Dungeon Geists]] at 4 mana 3/3 flying, locks one creature). This requires repeated mana/tap investments. Fair limited card.
