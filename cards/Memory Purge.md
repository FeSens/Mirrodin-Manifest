# Memory Purge

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Choose one —
>
> • Counter target spell if it has the same name as a card in any graveyard.
>
> • Exile up to three target cards from graveyards. If a legendary card was exiled this way, scry 2.
>
> *The Redaction-Myr never rest.*

## Flavor Text
> *"What records? There were never any records."*
> — Synod Archivist

## Image Prompt
> Memory Purge — Instant. Action depicted: A Redaction-Myr hunched over chrome tablets, methodically scratching names away with ink-stained fingers, while ghostly remnants of erased text still faintly glow. Setting: Synod archives, other Myr carrying tablets to melting furnaces in background. Focal point: The scratching fingers and the fading ghost-glow of purged information. Mood: Institutional horror, Orwellian erasure. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, ghostly text white fading to nothing, archive shadows.

## Design Notes
- Graveyard hate with flexibility
- Counters "repeat offenses" (spells cast from graveyard or copies)
- Specifically rewards exiling legendary cards (the important names)
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Great Ep-Styn Mystery]] - The Redaction-Myr scrubbing Ep-Styn's records
- Blue's manipulation of information
- Pairs with: [[Redaction-Myr]], [[The Black Ledger]], [[Control The Narrative]], [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Surgical Extraction]] effects (after targeting one copy), Mill strategies (fill graveyards to enable counterspell mode), [[Snapcaster Mage]] (flashback this for value)
- **Potential Combos:** None
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Both modes are situational. Good utility card but not broken.
