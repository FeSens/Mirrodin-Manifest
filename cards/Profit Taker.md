# Profit Taker

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Rogue

## Rules Text
> Whenever you win a gamble, each opponent loses 1 life and you gain 1 life.

## Flavor Text
> *"Your loss is my gain. Literally."*

## Image Prompt
> Profit Taker, Human Rogue from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Dross Dominion — a dim gambling den at the edge of Mephidross. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Pose: Crouching at the edge of a table, sweeping coins toward themselves while others fight. Key visual elements: Iron-veined skin barely visible under a dark hood, chrome fingernails clicking coins, glinting eyes in shadow. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Near-black, dark olive, gold coin highlights.

## Design Notes
- Black common creature - addresses Black common gap (-13)
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] synergy - rewards winning gambles with drain
- Encourages building around gamble mechanic
- Low stats but powerful trigger
- Pairs with [[The House Edge]], [[Glimmervoid Broker]], [[Hedge Fund Manager]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Krark's Thumb]] 75% win rate = consistent life drain; [[Exquisite Blood]] life gain triggers, enabling combo potential; [[Sanguine Bond]] life gain = opponent life loss doubled
- **Potential Combos:** [[Exquisite Blood]] + [[Sanguine Bond]] - won gamble triggers infinite loop if opponent has life; Multiple Profit Takers stack for more drain per win; [[Gray Merchant of Asphodel]] devotion from black creatures
- **Balance Assessment:** Balanced at common - 2 mana 2/1, requires winning gambles for the drain. Exquisite Blood combo requires another rare enchantment
