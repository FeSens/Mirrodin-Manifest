## Image Prompt
> Reckless Gambit — Sorcery. Action depicted: A desperate gambler with chrome-traced veins throwing their last gold coin into a glowing fortune pit. Setting: Glimmervoid casino, gold and white light cascading around chance tables. Focal point: The coin mid-air, suspended between hope and ruin. Mood: False promise, desperate yearning. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Seb McKinnon.

## Design Notes
- Red common sorcery - addresses Red common gap (-6)
- Classic Red card filtering/looting
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Synergizes with [[🎲 GAMBLE]] theme
- Pairs with: [[The Rigged Game]], [[Bubble Speculator]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Madness cards ([[Fiery Temper]], [[Blazing Rootwalla]]) - discard a madness card, cast for cheaper. [[Anje Falkenrath]] (madness commander synergy). [[Drake Haven]] (create 2/2 when you discard). [[Archfiend of Ifnir]] (-1/-1 counters when you discard)
- **Potential Combos:** Standard reanimator setups - discard big creature, reanimate later. [[Waste Not]] (opponent discard triggers, but this is self-discard)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - This is exactly [[Tormenting Voice]] (same cost, same effect). Established as balanced. Perfectly fine for common.
