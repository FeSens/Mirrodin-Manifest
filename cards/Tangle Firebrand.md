# Tangle Firebrand

## Card Type Line
Creature — Elf Shaman

## Rules Text
> Trample
>
> Whenever you cast a creature spell, Tangle Firebrand gets +2/+0 until end of turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Tangle's fury burns hotter than any forge."*

## Image Prompt
> Tangle Firebrand, Elf Shaman from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Tangle edge meeting Oxidda forges — where copper forest meets volcanic fire. Mood: Buried rage. Pose: Standing defiant, flames wreathing their form. Key visual elements: Copper-flame aura, metallic hair crackling with fire, burning vines extending from hands. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Rebecca Guay. Color palette: Copper, furnace orange, forest green.

## Design Notes
- RG signpost uncommon - creature-heavy aggro theme
- Rewards creature-heavy decks
- Trample to push damage
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Tangle Resistance]]
- Pairs with: [[Tangle Hunter]], [[Furnace Populist]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Beast Whisperer]] (creature casting triggers), [[Guardian Project]], [[Aluren]] (free creatures)
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Aluren]] + cheap creature loops could make this arbitrarily large, but requires combat to win
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Requires creature-heavy strategy and still needs to attack
