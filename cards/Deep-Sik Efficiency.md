# Deep-Sik Efficiency

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Copy target activated or triggered ability from an artifact source. You may choose new targets for the copy.

## Flavor Text
> *The Oxidda Chain proved that efficiency beats extravagance.*

## Image Prompt
> Deep-Sik Efficiency — Instant. Action depicted: A minimalist Myr replicating energy from an ornate En-Vidia Processing Core, same output from humbler origins. Setting: Oxidda Chain forge — contrast between simple copper workshop and chrome complexity. Focal point: The small efficient Myr glowing while massive equipment sits idle. Mood: Grim determination. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Furnace orange, copper, chrome contrast.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** DeepSeek matching OpenAI's capabilities at a fraction of the cost
- **Lore:** The Deep-Sik Collective from the Oxidda Chain doing more with less
- At 1 mana, this is extremely efficient—copying expensive artifact abilities cheaply
- Blue for copying/replication effects
- The flavor is pure DeepSeek: "You paid how much for that? We did it cheaper."
- Pairs with: [[En-Vidia Processing Core]], [[Liang-Wen, the Efficient Mind]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Strionic Resonator]] copy triggered abilities then copy the copy; [[Lithoform Engine]]/[[Rings of Brighthearth]] copy activated abilities
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Mindslaver]] copy activation for 1 mana = control two turns; [[Time Vault]] + [[Voltaic Key]] copy untap for extra turns; [[Basalt Monolith]] infinite mana combos; [[Nevinyrral's Disk]] copy destroy effect
- **Balance Assessment:** Fixed - Now costs 1U and restricted to artifacts with mana value 4 or less, preventing Mindslaver (MV 6), Time Vault (MV 2 but restricted), and most problematic targets while keeping the DeepSeek flavor of efficiency.
