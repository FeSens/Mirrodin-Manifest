## Image Prompt
> Rage-Fueled Striker, Human Berserker from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Great Furnace — molten metal channels and forge pits. Mood: Buried rage. Pose: Mid-charge with arms thrown wide, screaming. Key visual elements: Veins of molten copper visible beneath translucent skin, iron-reinforced knuckles, furnace-singed hair with metallic strands. Style reference: Kev Walker. Color palette: Furnace orange, copper, deep red.

## Design Notes
- Red common creature - addresses Red common gap (-6)
- Aggressive 1-drop with pump ability
- Must-attack downside for flavor
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Goblin Bushwhacker]] (hasty 1-drops work well together), [[Mana Echoes]] (Human tribal mana generation), [[Cavalcade of Calamity]] (deals 1 damage when 1-power creature attacks), [[Raid Bombardment]] (similar effect)
- **Potential Combos:** None significant - basic aggressive creature
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Compare to [[Goblin Guide]] (2/2 haste for R with downside) or [[Monastery Swiftspear]] (1/2 prowess). This is significantly weaker than pushed 1-drops. Must-attack is a real downside. Fine for common.
