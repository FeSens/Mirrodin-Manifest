## Power/Toughness
> 2/4

## Image Prompt
> Mad-Uro, the Hollow Throne, Human Advisor from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: A crumbling throne room — opulent but decaying, fires visible through distant windows. Mood: False promise collapsing, paranoid desperation. Pose: Sitting rigid on an oversized chrome throne, knuckles white on armrests, eyes darting as Myr servants stand unpowered around him. Key visual elements: Corpulent figure in oil-stained red and black robes, hollow crown sitting crooked, gold leaf peeling from walls, sweat on iron-veined brow. Style reference: Seb McKinnon meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Near-black, deep red, tarnished gold, distant fire orange, decay seeping through opulence.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Nicolás Maduro, Venezuelan president captured during Operation Absolute Resolve
- **Counter synergy:** Loyalty counters drain as you exploit your people for mana
- [[Hype Cycle]] doubles loyalty (false hope!) but Chapter III strips it all
- [[Compound]] can restore loyalty, [[Market Crash]] removes all support instantly
- Death trigger scales inversely—die with loyalty = opponents gain intel
- 2/4 stats: defensive, not a fighter himself
- Black/Red represents tyranny, desperation, and resource extraction
- Pairs with: [[Operation Absolute Resolve]], [[Sanctum of the Despot]], [[Terrified Survivor]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Pitiless Plunderer]] (death triggers generate treasure), Haste enablers like [[Fervor]] (immediate mana from creatures), Proliferate effects like [[Inexorable Tide]] (add loyalty counters back)
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Intruder Alarm]] + Mad-Uro + any repeatable creature generator (like [[Squirrel Nest]] + basic land) = potentially infinite mana. Each creature enters, untaps all creatures, they tap for BR removing loyalty, but new creature ETBs add more untaps than loyalty removed. Actually requires 4+ creatures generating to go infinite.
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN - The Intruder Alarm combo needs testing. The "3 creature minimum" requirement and death trigger punish provide some safety valve, but monitor in testing.
