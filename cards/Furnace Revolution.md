# Furnace Revolution

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Gain control of all artifacts until end of turn. Untap them. They become artifact creatures with base power and toughness 4/4 with haste until end of turn.
>
> At the beginning of the next end step, sacrifice each artifact you gained control of this way.

## Flavor Text
> *"The machines rose against their masters, if only for a glorious moment."*

## Image Prompt
> Furnace Revolution — Sorcery. Action depicted: Myr and constructs turning against their Foundry overseers, metal hands raised in rebellion as they transform into 4/4 warriors. Setting: The Great Furnace/Mer-Ikan Foundry — moment of uprising on foundry floor. Focal point: The moment of transformation, artifacts becoming creatures with murderous intent. Mood: Buried rage. Style reference: Seb McKinnon meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Furnace orange, chrome rebels, bronze overseers falling, dark red revolution flames.

## Design Notes
- Red mythic sorcery - addresses Red mythic gap (-3)
- Splashy game-ending effect
- Threaten all artifacts simultaneously
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]]
- Pairs with: [[Myr-Sourced Automation]], [[Simulated Labor Myr]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Mycosynth Lattice]] (all permanents are artifacts; this becomes "gain control of everything, make it 4/4, sacrifice it all"), [[Dockside Extortionist]] (steal opponent's treasures, swing as 4/4s), [[Unwinding Clock]] (untap synergy with stolen artifacts), [[Teferi's Protection]] (opponent's response fizzles the sacrifice)
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Mycosynth Lattice]] + Furnace Revolution = 6 mana one-sided Plague Wind that also kills all their lands, enchantments, everything. Opponent sacrifices their entire board.
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN - With Mycosynth Lattice, this is a one-sided "opponent sacrifices all permanents" for 6 mana total (Lattice already on board). Without Lattice, it's a strong but fair finisher.
