# Data Harvest Drone

## Card Type Line
Artifact Creature — Thopter

## Rules Text
> Flying
>
> Whenever Data Harvest Drone deals combat damage to a player, put a data counter on it, then look at the top X cards of that player's library, where X is the number of data counters on it. Put those cards back in any order.

## Flavor Text
> *"It sees everything. It remembers everything. It tells everything."*

## Image Prompt
> Data Harvest Drone, Thopter from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Seat of the Synod/En-Vidia Lattice — aerial surveillance above chrome cityscape. Mood: Suspicion. Pose: Gliding silently, multiple camera-eyes tracking below. Key visual elements: Sleek chrome carapace, lens clusters for eyes, data streams flowing to distant tower. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome silver, cyan data trails.

## Design Notes
- Data counters accumulate, scaling information gathering
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles data counters → see more cards, [[COMPOUND]] adds counters
- Flying makes it consistent at dealing damage
- Surveillance/data harvesting theme
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]] - data collection
- Pairs with: [[The Orb-Seekers]], [[En-Vidia Processing Core]], [[Thought-Sync Node]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Proliferate effects ([[Atraxa, Praetors' Voice]], [[Contagion Engine]]) to rapidly scale data counters, [[Mask of the Mimic]] / [[Spy Network]] for information advantage, [[Lantern of Insight]] + mill (knowledge of opponent's draws enables lock)
- **Potential Combos:** With proliferate + [[Codex Shredder]] style effects: Lock opponent out of drawing good cards
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Requires combat damage connection. Information advantage isn't directly game-winning.
