# Data Harvest Drone

## Card Type Line
Artifact Creature — Thopter

## Rules Text
> Flying
>
> Whenever Data Harvest Drone deals combat damage to a player, put a data counter on it, then look at that many cards from the top of that player's library, where X is the number of data counters on it. Put them back in any order.

## Flavor Text
> *"It sees everything. It remembers everything. It tells everything."*

## Image Prompt
> A sleek surveillance thopter with multiple camera-like eyes, gliding silently over a Mirrodin city. Data streams flow from its sensors to a distant tower. Chrome and glass, silent menace.

## Design Notes
- Data counters accumulate, scaling information gathering
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles data counters → see more cards, [[COMPOUND]] adds counters
- Flying makes it consistent at dealing damage
- Surveillance/data harvesting theme
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]] - data collection
- Pairs with: [[The Orb-Seekers]], [[En-Vidia Processing Core]], [[Thought-Sync Node]]
