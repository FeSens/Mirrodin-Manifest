## Image Prompt
> The Ledger Surfaces — Saga. Visual focus: The Black Ledger rising dramatically from the Quicksilver Sea. Setting: Waters near the Seat of the Synod — moment of revelation. Focal point: Pages flipping open revealing glowing names, High Artificers recoiling in horror, Unforged spirits swirling triumphantly. Mood: Genuine hope mixed with institutional horror. Style reference: Seb McKinnon meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: White truth-light, black shadow secrets, chrome waters, golden names.

## Design Notes
- **Saga synergy:** [[Hype Cycle]] doubles lore counters = skip to later chapters faster
- **Unforged synergy:** Creates tokens with spark counters for [[Spark Harvester]], [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]]
- **Political theme:** The truth comes out, but at a cost—Chapter IV returns the evidence
- **Lore connection:** [[Lore#The Great Ep-Styn Mystery]], [[The Black Ledger]], [[Control The Narrative]]
- **Color pair:** Orzhov (W/B) - secrets, sacrifice, justice
- **Pairs with:** [[The Black Ledger]], [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]], [[Unforged Witness]], [[Veiled Client]], [[Silenced Accuser]]
- The rich can pay their way out (sacrifice) or suffer exposure (life loss)
- Chapter IV shows how the powerful always escape—evidence returned, but witnesses created

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Clockspinning]], Proliferate, [[Power Conduit]]
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** Skip to Chapter IV quickly with lore counter manipulation
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Saga timing limits abuse
