- Cheap removal/tempo for Blue at common
- Simple NWO-compliant design

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Frost Titan]] (similar tap-down effects), [[Dungeon Geists]] (lock down creatures), [[Niblis of Frost]] (prowess tap synergy), [[Chilling Trap]] (compare: similar card)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Classic design at appropriate cost. Good common.
