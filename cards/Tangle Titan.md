# Tangle Titan

## Card Type Line
Creature — Elemental

## Rules Text
> Trample, reach
>
> Whenever you win a gamble, put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control.
>
> {2}{G}: Gamble. Activate only once each turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Tangle rewards those who embrace chaos."*

## Image Prompt
> A massive elemental of twisted metal vines and chrome leaves, towering over the Tangle. Dice-shaped fruits hang from its branches. Fortune flows through its roots.

## Design Notes
- Green Mythic - addresses Green mythic gap (-3, critical!)
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] synergy - rewards all creatures when you win
- Built-in gamble activation (once per turn)
- Massive body with relevant keywords
- Pairs with [[Kha-Sino, Fortune's Dealer]], [[Jackpot Wurm]]
- Green's apex predator for Gamble archetype

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Krark's Thumb]] gives 75% chance to put +1/+1 counters on ALL creatures each turn; [[Hardened Scales]]/[[Doubling Season]] doubles the +1/+1 counters placed on each creature; [[Corpsejack Menace]] makes each won gamble put 2 counters instead of 1
- **Potential Combos:** [[Krark's Thumb]] + [[Seedborn Muse]] gamble every turn with high odds; [[Walking Ballista]]/[[Triskelion]] with counter doublers - won gambles fuel infinite damage combos
- **Balance Assessment:** Balanced at 7 mana with "once each turn" restriction. Strong with Krark's Thumb but not format-breaking
