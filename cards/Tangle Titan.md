Creature — Elemental

## Rules Text

## Flavor Text
> *"The Tangle rewards those who embrace chaos."*

## Image Prompt
> Tangle Titan, Elemental from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Tangle — towering above the copper forest canopy. Mood: Genuine hope. Pose: Standing triumphant, arms raised as fortune energy radiates outward. Key visual elements: Massive form of twisted chrome vines and copper leaves, dice-shaped fruits hanging from branches, fortune light flowing through root system. Style reference: Seb McKinnon meets Rebecca Guay. Color palette: Copper, forest green, golden fortune glow.

## Design Notes
- Green Mythic - addresses Green mythic gap (-3, critical!)
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] synergy - rewards all creatures when you win
- Built-in gamble activation (once per turn)
- Massive body with relevant keywords
- Pairs with [[Kha-Sino, Fortune's Dealer]], [[Jackpot Wurm]]
- Green's apex predator for Gamble archetype

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Krark's Thumb]] gives 75% chance to put +1/+1 counters on ALL creatures each turn; [[Hardened Scales]]/[[Doubling Season]] doubles the +1/+1 counters placed on each creature; [[Corpsejack Menace]] makes each won gamble put 2 counters instead of 1
- **Potential Combos:** [[Krark's Thumb]] + [[Seedborn Muse]] gamble every turn with high odds; [[Walking Ballista]]/[[Triskelion]] with counter doublers - won gambles fuel infinite damage combos
- **Balance Assessment:** Balanced at 7 mana with "once each turn" restriction. Strong with Krark's Thumb but not format-breaking
