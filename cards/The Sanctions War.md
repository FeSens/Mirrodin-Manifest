# The Sanctions War

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> Players can't search libraries.
>
> Whenever a player would draw a card except the first one they draw in each of their draw steps, that player may instead look at the top two cards of their library and put one into their hand and the other on the bottom.
>
> *"Cut them off from our Cores. Watch them build their own."*

## Flavor Text
> *The Foundry thought scarcity would cripple the Oxidda Chain. It only made them resourceful.*

## Image Prompt
> A border checkpoint between gleaming Mer-Ikan territory and the rugged Oxidda mountains. En-Vidia Processing Cores are stacked behind barriers on one side, forbidden from crossing. On the other side, Oxidda artificers work with scraps and recycled parts, building something that glows with similar power. The checkpoint guards look smug; the Oxidda workers look determined. MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** US chip sanctions against China; Nvidia H200 export restrictions
- **Lore:** The Mer-Ikan Foundry banning export of En-Vidia Cores to the Oxidda Chain
- "Players can't search libraries" = no free access to specific resources
- The replacement draw effect represents making do with what you find
- Red for resourcefulness, defiance, and overcoming restrictions
- Symmetrical effect—sanctions hurt everyone
- Pairs with: [[Liang-Wen, the Efficient Mind]], [[Deep-Sik Efficiency]]
