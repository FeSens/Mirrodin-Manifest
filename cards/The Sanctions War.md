# The Sanctions War

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> Players can't search libraries.
>
> Whenever a player would draw a card except the first one they draw in each of their draw steps, that player may instead look at the top two cards of their library and put one into their hand and the other on the bottom.
>
> *"Cut them off from our Cores. Watch them build their own."*

## Flavor Text
> *The Foundry thought scarcity would cripple the Oxidda Chain. It only made them resourceful.*

## Image Prompt
> The Sanctions War — Enchantment. Visual focus: Border checkpoint blocking En-Vidia Cores from crossing to Oxidda. Setting: Border between Mer-Ikan territory and Oxidda mountains — gleaming vs rugged. Focal point: Stacked forbidden Cores on one side, determined Oxidda artificers building alternatives from scraps on the other, smug checkpoint guards between. Mood: Grim determination. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Furnace orange, copper Oxidda, chrome barrier, dark red restrictions.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** US chip sanctions against China; Nvidia H200 export restrictions
- **Lore:** The Mer-Ikan Foundry banning export of En-Vidia Cores to the Oxidda Chain
- "Players can't search libraries" = no free access to specific resources
- The replacement draw effect represents making do with what you find
- Red for resourcefulness, defiance, and overcoming restrictions
- Symmetrical effect—sanctions hurt everyone
- Pairs with: [[Liang-Wen, the Efficient Mind]], [[Deep-Sik Efficiency]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Aven Mindcensor]], [[Leonin Arbiter]], [[Stranglehold]]
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** Stacks with other search denial for complete library lockout
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Symmetrical effect with slight upside on extra draws; 3 mana is appropriate for this stax piece
