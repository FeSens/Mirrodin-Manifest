# Gilded Sentinel's Decree

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Choose one or both —
>
> • Exile all creatures that weren't cast from their owner's hand.
>
> • Until your next turn, players can't cast spells with mana value greater than the number of lands they control.

## Flavor Text
> *"The unrefined have no place within these walls. The overleveraged have no voice within this chamber."*
> — Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel

## Image Prompt
> Gilded Sentinel's Decree — Sorcery. Action depicted: A massive proclamation scroll unfurling from Tromp's balcony, golden light radiating outward as creatures without proper origin dissolve into exile, others cowering beneath the decree's reach. Setting: The Great Furnace, the Darksteel Wall looming in the distance. Focal point: The blinding golden decree rippling across the land. Mood: Institutional horror, authoritarian grandeur. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: Brilliant golds, whites, burnished bronze, dark red shadows.

## Design Notes
- First mode: Mass exile for tokens/reanimated/cheated creatures (deportation)
- Second mode: Mana value restriction (interest cap / anti-leverage)
- "Choose one or both" gives flexibility
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - Tromp's signature policy card
- White's "law and order" taken to authoritarian extreme
- Pairs with: [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[The Darksteel Wall]], [[Foundry Border Commander]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Bitterblossom]] (unaffected; you cast it, tokens are expendable), [[Containment Priest]] (different angle, but similar hate), [[Armageddon]] (follow up with land destruction = no one casts anything)
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** Gilded Sentinel's Decree (mode 2) + [[Armageddon]]/[[Ravages of War]] = Permanent spell lock. At 0 lands, only 0-cost spells are castable. [[Winter Orb]] + Decree = Soft lock on expensive spells.
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN - Mode 1 is a meta-dependent hoser. Mode 2 combined with land destruction creates a hard lock. The "until your next turn" duration prevents infinite lock solo, but in multiplayer or with Seedborn Muse effects, it's oppressive.
