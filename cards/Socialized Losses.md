# Socialized Losses

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Each player creates a Debt token. Then choose two Debt tokens and redistribute them. *(A Debt token is an artifact that enters with two debt counters and "At the beginning of your upkeep, you lose 1 life, then remove a debt counter from this. When the last debt counter is removed, sacrifice it." To redistribute, remove all counters from them, then each gets half that many counters, rounded down.)*

## Flavor Text
> *"Privatize the profits. Socialize the losses."*

## Image Prompt
> Socialized Losses — Sorcery. Action depicted: Synod bureaucrats with chrome skulls distributing debt tokens evenly among citizens below, the wealthy looking relieved while the poor stagger under burden. Setting: Seat of the Synod grand council chamber, Azorius architecture of white and blue chrome. Focal point: Debt tokens falling like rain onto the masses below. Mood: Institutional horror. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: Steel blue, white, gold debt tokens.

## Design Notes
- Azorius uncommon sorcery
- Everyone gets debt, then equalized
- Perfect political commentary
- Can be played when ahead on debt to equalize
- Pairs with: [[Central Bank Governor]], [[The Bailout]], [[Debt Ceiling]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Smothering Tithe]] (opponents get Debt tokens), Group hug/slug strategies (redistribution effects)
- **Balance Assessment:** Needs Debt Token Definition - Balance depends entirely on what Debt tokens do in this set.
