# Debt Restructuring

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Redistribute among two target Debt tokens. *(To redistribute, remove all counters from them, then put half that many counters on each of them, rounded down.)*

## Flavor Text
> *"The burden is now... shared."*

## Image Prompt
> Debt Restructuring — Sorcery. Action depicted: White-robed bureaucrats redistributing glowing debt markers between chrome contracts on a balance scale. Setting: The Great Furnace/Mer-Ikan Foundry — redistribution chamber. Focal point: The scales tipping as markers flow between contracts. Mood: Institutional horror. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: White robes, chrome contracts, red debt markers.

## Design Notes
- White common sorcery
- Core debt redistribution at common
- Redistributes debt counters among all Debt tokens
- Can strategically spread or concentrate debt
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] primary access
- Pairs with: [[Central Bank Governor]], [[The Grand Equalizer]], [[Spite Redistributor]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** The Grand Equalizer (in set) - More redistribution effects, Multiple Debts in play (concentrate counters on opponent's Debts)
- **Potential Combos:** None
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Requires board state to matter.
