# Sanctuary Manifest

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> Creature tokens you control that were created this turn have hexproof.
>
> Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, if it wasn't cast from your hand, put a +1/+1 counter on it.
>
> {2}, Exile a creature card from your graveyard: Create a token that's a copy of that card, except it's a Refugee in addition to its other types.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Furnace calls them 'unregistered.' We call them family."*
> — Sanctuary doctrine

## Image Prompt
> A hidden grove within the Tangle where refugees from across Mirrodin have gathered. Leonin warriors stand guard while Mephidross survivors receive food and healing. A Viridian elder performs a blessing over new arrivals. Makeshift shelters blend into the copper trees. Warm green and white light filters through metallic leaves. Hope amid persecution. MTG card art style, sanctuary, resistance, found family.

## Design Notes
- **Anti-Tromp:** Direct counter to [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]]'s "not cast from hand" hate
- **Token/Reanimation support:** Buffs tokens and cheated creatures
- **Refugee theme:** Creates Refugee type for tribal synergy
- **Lore connection:** [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]], [[Sanctuary City Warden]], [[Hidden Community Elder]]
- **Color pair:** Selesnya (G/W) - community, protection, growth
- **Pairs with:** [[Tunneling Hopeful]], [[Mephidross Refugee]], [[Asylum Seeker]], [[Zel-Ensk, the Resilient Spark]], [[DREAM Act Advocate]]
- Counter synergy: +1/+1 counters work with [[Hype Cycle]]
- The graveyard ability represents giving the fallen a second chance
- "Refugee" creature type creates new tribal connections

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Doubling Season]] doubles tokens and +1/+1 counters; [[Anointed Procession]] doubles token copies; [[Sneak Attack]]/[[Through the Breach]] creatures not cast get buffed
- **BROKEN INFINITE COMBO:** Persist creatures ([[Kitchen Finks]], [[Murderous Redcap]]) + any sacrifice outlet = INFINITE LOOP. Persist creature dies, returns with -1/-1 counter. Sanctuary Manifest adds +1/+1 counter (wasn't cast from hand). Counters cancel out, creature is at full stats. Sacrifice again = infinite life (Finks) or infinite damage (Redcap)
- **Balance Assessment:** BROKEN - The +1/+1 counter on creatures not cast from hand enables infinite combos with Persist. Consider adding "nontoken" or "once each turn" restriction
