## Image Prompt
> Sanctuary Manifest — Enchantment. Visual focus: A hidden grove transformed into a sanctuary, the enchantment's magic making refugees part of something greater. Setting: The Tangle — makeshift shelters blending into copper trees, metallic leaves filtering warm light. Mood: Genuine hope. Key visual elements: Leonin warriors with chrome manes standing guard, Mephidross survivors with necrogen scars receiving healing, Viridian elder with copper-veined hands blessing new arrivals. Style reference: Rebecca Guay meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: Copper, forest green, warm white light.

## Design Notes
- **Anti-Tromp:** Direct counter to [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]]'s "not cast from hand" hate
- **Token/Reanimation support:** Buffs tokens and cheated creatures
- **Refugee theme:** Creates Refugee type for tribal synergy
- **Lore connection:** [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]], [[Sanctuary City Warden]], [[Hidden Community Elder]]
- **Color pair:** Selesnya (G/W) - community, protection, growth
- **Pairs with:** [[Tunneling Hopeful]], [[Mephidross Refugee]], [[Asylum Seeker]], [[Zel-Ensk, the Resilient Spark]], [[DREAM Act Advocate]]
- Counter synergy: +1/+1 counters work with [[Hype Cycle]]
- The graveyard ability represents giving the fallen a second chance
- "Refugee" creature type creates new tribal connections

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Doubling Season]] doubles tokens and +1/+1 counters; [[Anointed Procession]] doubles token copies; [[Sneak Attack]]/[[Through the Breach]] creatures not cast get buffed
- **BROKEN INFINITE COMBO:** Persist creatures ([[Kitchen Finks]], [[Murderous Redcap]]) + any sacrifice outlet = INFINITE LOOP. Persist creature dies, returns with -1/-1 counter. Sanctuary Manifest adds +1/+1 counter (wasn't cast from hand). Counters cancel out, creature is at full stats. Sacrifice again = infinite life (Finks) or infinite damage (Redcap)
- **Balance Assessment:** BROKEN - The +1/+1 counter on creatures not cast from hand enables infinite combos with Persist. Consider adding "nontoken" or "once each turn" restriction
