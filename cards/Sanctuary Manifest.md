# Sanctuary Manifest

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> Whenever a nontoken creature enters the battlefield under your control, if it wasn't cast, put a +1/+1 counter on it. This ability triggers only once each turn.
>
> {2}, Exile a creature card from your graveyard: Create a token that's a copy of that card, except it's a Refugee in addition to its other types.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Furnace calls them 'unregistered.' We call them family."*
> — Sanctuary doctrine

## Image Prompt
> Sanctuary Manifest — Enchantment. Visual focus: A hidden grove transformed into a sanctuary, the enchantment's magic making refugees part of something greater. Setting: The Tangle — makeshift shelters blending into copper trees, metallic leaves filtering warm light. Mood: Genuine hope. Key visual elements: Leonin warriors with chrome manes standing guard, Mephidross survivors with necrogen scars receiving healing, Viridian elder with copper-veined hands blessing new arrivals. Style reference: Rebecca Guay meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: Copper, forest green, warm white light.

## Design Notes
- **Anti-Tromp:** Direct counter to [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]]'s "not cast from hand" hate
- **Token/Reanimation support:** Buffs tokens and cheated creatures
- **Refugee theme:** Creates Refugee type for tribal synergy
- **Lore connection:** [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]], [[Sanctuary City Warden]], [[Hidden Community Elder]]
- **Color pair:** Selesnya (G/W) - community, protection, growth
- **Pairs with:** [[Tunneling Hopeful]], [[Mephidross Refugee]], [[Asylum Seeker]], [[Zel-Ensk, the Resilient Spark]], [[DREAM Act Advocate]]
- Counter synergy: +1/+1 counters work with [[Hype Cycle]]
- The graveyard ability represents giving the fallen a second chance
- "Refugee" creature type creates new tribal connections

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Doubling Season]] doubles tokens and +1/+1 counters; [[Anointed Procession]] doubles token copies; [[Sneak Attack]]/[[Through the Breach]] creatures not cast get buffed
- **Persist Interaction:** FIXED - The "once each turn" clause prevents infinite loops with persist creatures like [[Kitchen Finks]] or [[Murderous Redcap]]. Still provides value but not infinite.
- **Balance Assessment:** FIXED - The nontoken restriction and once-per-turn clause prevent abuse while maintaining the card's flavor and utility.
