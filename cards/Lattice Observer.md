# Lattice Observer

## Card Type Line
Creature — Vedalken Wizard

## Power/Toughness

## Image Prompt
> Lattice Observer, Vedalken Wizard from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Seat of the Synod — floating serenely above the Lattice network, data streams flowing past. Mood: Suspicion, detached analysis. Pose: Hovering in meditation, head slightly tilted, glowing eyes tracking multiple data flows simultaneously. Key visual elements: Chrome skin reflecting data-light, flowing robes merging with information streams, cards materializing and dissolving as the looting effect is represented. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan data-glow, deep observation-purple.

## Design Notes
- Blue 4-drop flyer with card filtering
- Fills 4-CMC gap at common
- Looting helps find key cards
- Pairs with: [[Lattice Interface]], [[Synod High Chancellor]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Madness cards (enables madness triggers), [[Archfiend of Ifnir]] (discard triggers), [[Drake Haven]] (creates additional tokens), [[Rielle, the Everwise]] (draw from discard)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - A 4-mana 2/4 flyer with loot is appropriate for common.
