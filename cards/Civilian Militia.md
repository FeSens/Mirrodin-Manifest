# Civilian Militia

## Card Type Line
Creature — Leonin Citizen Soldier

## Rules Text
> Civilian Militia enters the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it.
>

## Flavor Text
> *"We were farmers. Now we are soldiers. Our home demands it."*

## Image Prompt
> Civilian Militia, Leonin Citizen Soldier from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Tangle border — farmland being fortified against invasion. Mood: Grim determination. Pose: Standing in defensive line, farming tools converted to weapons raised. Key visual elements: Chrome-maned Leonin with determination counters glowing, metallic fur bristling, improvised copper-blade weapons. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Rebecca Guay. Color palette: Copper, forest green, gold determination glow.

## Design Notes
- Determination counters grow from losses
- Gets stronger as war continues
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles determination, [[COMPOUND]] adds more
- Civilian defenders becoming soldiers
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - Zel-Ensk's civilian resistance
- Pairs with: [[Zel-Ensk, the Resilient Spark]], [[War Refugee Camp]], [[Watchtower Defender]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Doubling Season]] (4 counters = 5/5 for 2!), [[Cathars' Crusade]] (counters everywhere), [[Hardened Scales]] (extra counters)
- **Potential Combos:** [[Doubling Season]] + this = 5/5 for 2 mana that grows further, [[Rite of Passage]] (combat damage adds counters)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - A 3/3 for 2 that can grow is strong but fair in GW. Doubling Season makes everything broken.
