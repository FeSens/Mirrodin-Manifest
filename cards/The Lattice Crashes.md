# The Lattice Crashes

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Each player sacrifices a creature for each counter removed from permanents they control this turn.
>
> If no counters were removed this turn, instead each player sacrifices a creature for each type of counter among permanents they control.

## Flavor Text
> *"The En-Vidia promised infinite returns. It delivered infinite losses."*
> — Final broadcast from the Synod Trading Floor

## Image Prompt
> The En-Vidia Lattice shattering in a catastrophic cascade, nodes exploding in sequence like dominoes. Vedalken traders falling from platforms as the floor beneath them dissolves. Myr constructs going haywire, attacking randomly. Gold tokens melting into worthless puddles. The sky above Lumengrid filled with debris and screaming. Black and red energy tears through chrome structures. Apocalyptic, MTG card art style, financial/technological collapse, maximum chaos.

## Design Notes
- **Combo piece:** Devastating after [[Market Crash]] or [[Hype Cycle]] Chapter III
- **Standalone mode:** Still powerful—punishes counter-heavy boards
- **Counter synergy:** Connects to ALL counter strategies in the set
- **Lore connection:** [[Lore#The Great Doubt (The AI Hype Correction)]] - The inevitable collapse
- **Color pair:** Rakdos (B/R) - destruction, sacrifice, chaos
- **Pairs with:** [[Hype Cycle]], [[Market Crash]], [[Gold Token]], [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]]
- **Anti-synergy:** Devastating to your own counter strategies if mistimed
- Creates tension: Do you remove counters first for value, or keep them and risk this?
