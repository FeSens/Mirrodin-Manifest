# The Lattice Crashes

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Each player sacrifices a creature for each counter removed from permanents they control this turn.
>
> If no counters were removed this turn, instead each player sacrifices a creature for each type of counter among permanents they control.

## Flavor Text
> *"The En-Vidia promised infinite returns. It delivered infinite losses."*
> — Final broadcast from the Synod Trading Floor

## Image Prompt
> The Lattice Crashes — Sorcery. Action depicted: The En-Vidia Lattice shattering in catastrophic cascade, nodes exploding like dominoes. Setting: Lumengrid and the Synod trading floor — total systemic collapse. Focal point: Vedalken traders falling from dissolving platforms, Myr going haywire, gold melting to worthless puddles. Mood: Buried rage. Style reference: Seb McKinnon meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Black and red destruction energy, chrome debris, dead gold.

## Design Notes
- **Combo piece:** Devastating after [[Market Crash]] or [[Hype Cycle]] Chapter III
- **Standalone mode:** Still powerful—punishes counter-heavy boards
- **Counter synergy:** Connects to ALL counter strategies in the set
- **Lore connection:** [[Lore#The Great Doubt (The AI Hype Correction)]] - The inevitable collapse
- **Color pair:** Rakdos (B/R) - destruction, sacrifice, chaos
- **Pairs with:** [[Hype Cycle]], [[Market Crash]], [[Gold Token]], [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]]
- **Anti-synergy:** Devastating to your own counter strategies if mistimed
- Creates tension: Do you remove counters first for value, or keep them and risk this?

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Vampire Hexmage]] (instant counter removal), [[Aether Snap]], [[Thief of Blood]]
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Vampire Hexmage]] removes all counters from a permanent, then this forces sacrifice equal to counters removed; with [[Dark Depths]], that's 0 counters removed there but opponents with counters lose everything
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Requires setup and timing; punishes counter-heavy strategies
