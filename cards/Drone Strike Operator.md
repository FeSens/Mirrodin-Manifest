# Drone Strike Operator

## Card Type Line
Creature — Leonin Artificer

## Rules Text
> {T}: Create a 1/1 colorless Thopter artifact creature token with flying and "When this creature deals combat damage to a creature, destroy that creature."
>
> Thopter tokens you control have haste.

## Flavor Text
> *"We see them before they see us. We strike before they can react."*

## Image Prompt
> A Leonin technician piloting drones from a bunker, screens showing reconnaissance footage. Cheap drones devastate expensive targets.

## Design Notes
- Creates deadly Thopter tokens
- Haste on tokens for immediate strikes
- Asymmetric drone warfare
- Ukraine drone tactics reference
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - Zel-Ensk's forces using drone warfare
- Pairs with: [[Zel-Ensk, the Resilient Spark]], [[Foreign Arms Supplier]], [[Watchtower Defender]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Cathars' Crusade]] pumps each Thopter; [[Shared Animosity]] Thopters boost each other; [[Favorable Winds]] flying anthem
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Intruder Alarm]] = INFINITE - Each Thopter created untaps all creatures including the Operator. Create unlimited Thopters with haste; [[Seedborn Muse]] creates Thopters on each opponent's turn
- **Balance Assessment:** BROKEN - Creates infinite combo with Intruder Alarm (a commonly played card). The Thopters having deathtouch-like destroy ability AND haste makes them immediate lethal threats. Consider adding "Activate only once each turn"
