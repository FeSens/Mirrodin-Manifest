# Protective Ward

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Target creature gains indestructible until end of turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Synod protects its own."*

## Image Prompt
> Protective Ward — Instant. Action depicted: A hexagonal energy shield of golden light materializing around a Foundry soldier with chrome-inlaid armor, enemy strikes shattering harmlessly against it. Setting: Mer-Ikan Foundry battlefield. Focal point: The geometric perfection of the shield as weapons fragment against its surface. Mood: Grim determination, protection. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Volkan Baga. Color palette: Golds, bronze, protective white-gold energy, dark red battlefield.

## Design Notes
- White common instant - addresses White common gap (-5)
- Defensive combat trick
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Synod of Cognitive Accord]]
- Pairs with: [[Sanctuary City Warden]], [[Hidden Community Elder]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Blasphemous Act]] (your creature survives), [[Wrath of God]] effects (one-sided protection), [[Boros Reckoner]] (indestructible + damage reflection), [[Stuffy Doll]] (keep it alive through anything)
- **Potential Combos:** [[Pariah]] + Indestructible creature (redirect damage, never die - but this is only until EOT). [[Nevinyrral's Disk]] (protect one creature through the wipe)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - This is a slightly worse version of [[Sheltering Light]] (W, scry 1 + indestructible) or [[Ajani's Presence]] (strive option). Basic white protection at common. Perfectly fine.
