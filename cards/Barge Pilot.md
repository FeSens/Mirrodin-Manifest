# Barge Pilot

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Pilot

## Rules Text
> Barge Pilot crews Vehicles as though its power were 3.
>
> Whenever a Vehicle you control deals combat damage to a player, put a cargo counter on it.

## Flavor Text
> *"I don't ask what's in the hold. I don't count heads on the return."*

## Image Prompt
> A weathered human pilot at the helm of a Glimmer-Barge, staring straight ahead, refusing to look at the cargo hold behind them. Their hands grip the controls tightly. Complicity without witness.

## Design Notes
- Crews [[Glimmer-Barge]] easily (power 3 for crewing)
- Adds cargo counters to vehicles on damage
- Counter synergy: Cargo counters synergize with [[Hype Cycle]] and [[COMPOUND]]
- Common enabler for vehicle/trafficking theme
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Great Ep-Styn Mystery]] - pilots of the Glimmer-Barges
- Pairs with: [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]], [[Spark Harvester]], [[The Black Ledger]]
