# Barge Pilot

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Pilot

## Rules Text
> Barge Pilot crews Vehicles as though its power were 3.
>
> Whenever a Vehicle you control deals combat damage to a player, put a cargo counter on that Vehicle.

## Flavor Text
> *"I don't ask what's in the hold. I don't count heads on the return."*

## Image Prompt
> Barge Pilot, Human Pilot from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Dross Dominion — aboard a Glimmer-Barge crossing dark waters. Mood: Buried rage. Pose: Gripping helm controls, staring rigidly forward, deliberately not looking at cargo hold. Key visual elements: Weathered iron-veined face, white-knuckled chrome hands on controls, cargo counter glowing behind, necrogen mist rising. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Near-black waters, dark olive, sickly green glow.

## Design Notes
- Crews [[Glimmer-Barge]] easily (power 3 for crewing)
- Adds cargo counters to vehicles on damage
- Counter synergy: Cargo counters synergize with [[Hype Cycle]] and [[COMPOUND]]
- Common enabler for vehicle/trafficking theme
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Great Ep-Styn Mystery]] - pilots of the Glimmer-Barges
- Pairs with: [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]], [[Spark Harvester]], [[The Black Ledger]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Dermotaxi]] (crews easily, adds cargo counters), [[Shorikai, Genesis Engine]] (high value Vehicle target), [[Peacewalker Colossus]] (Vehicle synergy)
- **Potential Combos:** None
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Good Vehicle support creature. Cargo counters need set infrastructure.
