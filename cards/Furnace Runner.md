## Image Prompt
> Furnace Runner, Human Warrior from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Great Furnace/Oxidda — furnace district streets. Mood: Grim determination. Pose: Sprinting full speed, sparks trailing behind, aggressive forward momentum. Key visual elements: Lean iron-veined frame built for speed, furnace sparks in wake, hasty blur effect. Style reference: Kev Walker. Color palette: Furnace orange, copper skin, bronze sparks, dark red street surfaces.

## Design Notes
- Red aggressive 2-drop
- Vanilla+ design for NWO compliance
- Supports RW aggro and RB sacrifice archetypes
- Pairs with: [[Furnace Stoker]], [[Dream of the Furnace]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Goblin Bushwhacker]] (standard aggro redundancy), [[Lightning Bolt]] (curve out with burn), [[Embercleave]] (cheap creature to enable)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Standard red 2-drop, comparable to many existing designs.
