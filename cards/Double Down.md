## Image Prompt
> Double Down — Sorcery. Action depicted: A human gambler drawing cards from a chrome deck at a Glimmervoid table, gold tokens piling high as sweat beads on their brow. Setting: Glimmervoid casino — moment of high-stakes decision. Focal point: The trembling hand drawing cards, risk and reward balanced. Mood: Grim determination. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Gold tokens, white table, chrome cards, amber light.

## Design Notes
- Red common sorcery - addresses Red common gap (-16)
- Addresses common creature ratio issue
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] synergy - card draw with gamble risk
- Pairs with [[The House Edge]], [[Prompt-Sculptor Initiate]] (scry before wagering)
- Rummaging effect is core Red, gamble adds set flavor
- Simple design for NWO compliance

## Cross-Format Interactions
| External Card | Interaction |
|---------------|-------------|
| **[[Krark's Thumb]]** | Lets you flip twice and choose - significantly improves gamble odds |
| **[[Zndrsplt, Eye of Wisdom]]** | Coin flip synergy (if gamble uses coins) |
| **[[Chance Encounter]]** | Adds luck counters on coin flips toward alternate win |
| **Library Manipulation** ([[Brainstorm]], [[Ponder]]) | Stack your deck to win the CMC comparison |
| **High CMC Topdecks** ([[Emrakul, the Aeons Torn]], [[Draco]]) | Guarantees winning the gamble |
| **Madness Cards** | Discard outlet enables madness if you lose |
| **[[Hollow One]]** | Discarding multiple cards reduces Hollow One's cost |

**Format Assessment:**
- **Commander**: Decent card filtering; gamble adds variance that some playgroups enjoy
- **Modern/Legacy**: Compares to [[Faithless Looting]] (banned) but with downside variance
- **Limited**: Strong common - floor is still draw 2 discard 2, ceiling is draw 2 discard 1
