## Image Prompt
> Defecting Officer, Human Soldier from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Border between Dross Dominion and Mer-Ikan Foundry — burning settlement behind, freedom ahead. Mood: Grim determination. Pose: Walking away from destruction, torn insignia trailing, heading toward distant safety. Key visual elements: Iron-veined face showing inner conflict, chrome military armor half-removed, distant Leonin sentries watching. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Greg Staples. Color palette: White, black smoke, bronze flames behind.

## Design Notes
- Rewards opponent sacrifices (defection intel)
- Grows from enemy losses
- Counter synergy: +1/+1 counters synergize with [[Hype Cycle]] and [[COMPOUND]]
- Orzhov moral complexity
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - soldiers fleeing Put-In's regime
- Pairs with: [[Put-In, the Iron Despot]], [[Zel-Ensk, the Resilient Spark]], [[Nim Occupation Force]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Grave Pact]] / [[Dictate of Erebos]] (forces opponent to sacrifice, triggers growth), [[Smokestack]] (stax synergy, grows while locking opponents), [[Sheoldred, Whispering One]] (opponent sacrifice on upkeep = growth)
- **Potential Combos:** With [[Contamination]] + [[Bitterblossom]]: You sac tokens, opponent can't play spells, if they have creatures they may sac for your cards
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - The opponent chooses to sacrifice, and giving you 2 cards is optional. Growth is incidental.
