> Foundry Commander, Human Soldier from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Great Furnace/Mer-Ikan Foundry — battlefield at front lines. Mood: Grim determination. Pose: Leading charge with sword raised high, soldiers rallying behind. Key visual elements: Chrome armor with red accents, iron-veined face showing battle fervor, soldiers streaming behind in attack. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Furnace orange, white armor, chrome sword, dark red battlefield smoke.

## Design Notes
- RW signpost uncommon - aggressive go-wide theme
- Haste and first strike for aggression
- Team pump rewards wide boards
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Sanctions War (The Ukraine War)]]
- Pairs with: [[Civilian Militia]], [[Rally the Militia]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Aurelia, the Warleader]] (extra combat = extra pump triggers), [[Winota, Joiner of Forces]] (pulls humans into combat), [[Hero of Bladehold]] (creates attackers that get pumped), [[Krenko, Mob Boss]] (go-wide with pump)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Excellent RW aggro uncommon. Well-designed signpost.
