## Image Prompt
> Veiled Client, Human Noble from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Glimmer-Barge dock near Ep-Styn's Silent Isle — departing with secrets. Mood: Suspicion. Pose: Being escorted by Myr servants, clutching documents to chest, face obscured by hood. Key visual elements: Wealthy robes barely visible beneath concealing cloak, Private Isle looming in background, guilt counters faintly visible around their form. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Black hood, white noble robes beneath, gold accents, Isle's dark silhouette.

## Design Notes
- Protection from Unforged = witnesses can't touch them
- Guilt counters deplete as they "spend" their moral debt
- Dies when guilt runs out (justice catches up)
- Counter synergy: [[COMPOUND]]/[[Hype Cycle]] extends their guilt supply
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Great Ep-Styn Mystery]] - The Veiled Clients from the Black Ledger
- Pairs with: [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]], [[The Black Ledger]], [[Private Isle Guard]], [[Glimmer-Barge]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Proliferate, [[Solemnity]] (never loses guilt counters but can't draw!)
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** With [[Solemnity]], can't remove guilt counters so can't draw but also never dies - mild synergy
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Self-limiting design
