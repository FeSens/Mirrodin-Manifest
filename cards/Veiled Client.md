# Veiled Client

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Noble

## Rules Text
> Protection from Unforged.
>
> Veiled Client enters the battlefield with two guilt counters on it.
>
> At the beginning of your upkeep, if Veiled Client has no guilt counters on it, sacrifice it.
>
> {1}, Remove a guilt counter from Veiled Client: Draw a card. Activate only as a sorcery.

## Flavor Text
> *"My name was never in that ledger. I was never on that isle."*

## Image Prompt
> A wealthy noble in a hooded cloak, face obscured, being escorted off a Glimmer-Barge by Myr servants. They clutch documents close to their chest. The Private Isle looms behind them. Guilt and privilege.

## Design Notes
- Protection from Unforged = witnesses can't touch them
- Guilt counters deplete as they "spend" their moral debt
- Dies when guilt runs out (justice catches up)
- Counter synergy: [[COMPOUND]]/[[Hype Cycle]] extends their guilt supply
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Great Ep-Styn Mystery]] - The Veiled Clients from the Black Ledger
- Pairs with: [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]], [[The Black Ledger]], [[Private Isle Guard]], [[Glimmer-Barge]]
