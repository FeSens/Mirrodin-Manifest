## Image Prompt
> Tel-Jilad Arbiter, Elemental from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Tangle — ancient grove where copper trees form a natural tribunal. Mood: Grim determination. Pose: Standing in judgment, counters flowing between petitioners. Key visual elements: Massive form of copper bark and living wood, scales of balance formed from chrome branches, impartial gaze. Style reference: Seb McKinnon meets Rebecca Guay. Color palette: Copper, forest green, chrome accents.

## Design Notes
- Green uncommon Redistribute payoff
- Grows as you balance counters
- Synergizes with core set mechanics
- Pairs with: [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]], [[Nature's Rebalancing]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Doubling Season]] (double the +1/+1 counters gained), [[Hardened Scales]] (extra counter each redistribute), [[The Ozolith]] (stores counters when it dies)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - 5 mana 4/4 trample that grows is appropriate for uncommon. Depends on redistribute frequency; likely slow accumulation.
