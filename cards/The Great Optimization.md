# The Great Optimization

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> At the beginning of your upkeep, each player chooses a nontoken creature they control. Exile all other nontoken creatures.
>
> Whenever a creature is exiled, its controller creates a 1/1 colorless Myr artifact creature token.
>
> Creatures exiled with The Great Optimization have "When this card leaves exile, it enters the battlefield under its owner's control."

## Flavor Text
> *"Your position has been optimized. Please report to Reprocessing."*

## Image Prompt
> A sterile chrome processing facility where organic workers are being systematically scanned and ejected through portals while identical Myr units march out of production lines to replace them. The workers' faces show shock and betrayal. Overseers with clipboards check off names. Conveyor belts of identity. Cold, corporate, dehumanizing. Blue and black metallic tones. MTG card art style, dystopian automation, the lie of efficiency.

## Design Notes
- **AI/Automation theme:** The false promise of AI replacing workers
- **Board control:** Repeating exile effect keeps the board sparse
- **Myr synergy:** Creates tokens for [[Myr-Sourced Automation]], [[Simulated Labor Myr]]
- **Lore connection:** [[Lore#The Optimization Lie (AI-Washing)]], [[Displaced Worker]], [[Optimization Lie]]
- **Color pair:** Dimir (U/B) - manipulation, control, hidden agendas
- **Pairs with:** [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]] (anti-token), [[Reprocessing Agent]], [[Myr-Sourced Automation]]
- The exiled creatures "wait in the queue" and can return if enchantment removed
- Creates interesting tension: Keep one creature, lose the rest
- Opponents get Myr but lose their best creatures
