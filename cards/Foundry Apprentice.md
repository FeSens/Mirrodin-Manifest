# Foundry Apprentice

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Artificer

## Rules Text
> When Foundry Apprentice enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice an artifact. If you do, Foundry Apprentice deals 2 damage to any target.

## Flavor Text
> *"Every scrap has potential. Watch."*

## Image Prompt
> A young human feeding metal into a furnace, redirecting the molten spray toward an enemy.

## Design Notes
- Red common creature - addresses Red common gap (-6)
- Artifact sacrifice synergy for Mirrodin flavor
- Optional ability keeps NWO compliance
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]]
- Pairs with: [[Simulated Labor Myr]], [[Myr Replicant]]

## Cross-Format Interactions
| External Card | Interaction |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Treasure/Clue/Food Tokens** | Sacrifice for value + 2 damage |
| **Disciple of the Vault** | Triggers on artifact sacrifice for additional drain |
| **Marionette Master** | Stacks damage - sac artifact deals 4+ damage total |
| **Panharmonicon** | Doubles ETB - can sacrifice two artifacts for 4 damage |
| **Reckoner Bankbuster** | Create tokens to sacrifice later |
| **Blood Artist / Zulaport Cutthroat** | If sacrificing artifact creatures, triggers death synergies |
| **Oni-Cult Anvil** | Creates artifact tokens to sacrifice |
| **Jan Jansen, Chaos Crafter** | Generates artifacts and wants sacrifice outlets |

**Format Assessment:**
- **Limited**: Solid common - 3/2 body with potential 2 damage upside
- **Modern/Legacy**: Fits into artifact sacrifice shells (Affinity, Anvil decks)
- **Commander**: Works with artifact token generators and aristocrats themes
