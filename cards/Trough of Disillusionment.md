# Trough of Disillusionment

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> Artifact creatures enter the battlefield tapped and don't untap during their controllers' untap steps.
>
> At the beginning of each player's upkeep, that player may pay {2}. If they do, untap all artifact creatures they control.
>
> *"It works. Just not as well as they promised."*

## Flavor Text
> *The Myr still function. They just don't perform miracles.*

## Image Prompt
> Trough of Disillusionment — Enchantment. Visual focus: Once-gleaming En-Vidia Processing Core now dormant and dust-covered. Setting: En-Vidia Lattice facility — aftermath of broken promises. Focal point: Disappointed Vedalken technicians with crossed arms, declining charts on walls, dim lighting as power diverts elsewhere, motionless Myr awaiting commands that never come. Mood: Exhaustion. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Dulled steel blue, dusty chrome, fading cyan, disappointed grays.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Gartner's Hype Cycle - GenAI entering the Trough of Disillusionment in 2025
- **Lore:** The moment Mirrodin realizes the En-Vidia Lattice isn't delivering
- Artifact creatures still work, but require ongoing investment (pay {2}) to function
- Symmetrical effect—everyone's AI dreams are deflated
- Blue/Black for broken promises and institutional disillusionment
- The pay-to-untap represents "it works, but costs more than advertised"
- Pairs with: [[Hype Cycle]], [[Sal-Tman's Promise]], [[The Vibe Shift]]
