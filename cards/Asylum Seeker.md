## Image Prompt
> Asylum Seeker, Human Citizen from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Mer-Ikan Foundry — sterile processing center with endless queues. Mood: Exhaustion. Pose: Seated at processing desk, papers clutched tightly, staring at numbered ticket. Key visual elements: Faint golden hope counter glowing on chest, iron-veined skin showing wear, eyes holding last flicker of light. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Rebecca Guay. Color palette: Golds, bronze, faded white, institutional gray.

## Design Notes
- Hope counter provides protection
- Grows from adversity (+1/+1 from damage)
- Loses hope when targeted (system breaks you)
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles hope = more resilience, [[Market Crash]] removes all hope
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - refugees seeking safety
- Pairs with: [[The Darksteel Wall]], [[Sanctuary City Warden]], [[DREAM Act Advocate]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Solemnity]] (can't lose hope counter - permanent hexproof!), [[The Ozolith]] (saves counters when dies), [[Hardened Scales]] (more +1/+1 counters from damage)
- **Notable Combos:** [[Solemnity]] prevents counters but hope counter is placed on ETB, so Solemnity interaction is neutral.
- **Balance Assessment:** FIXED - Changed trigger from "becomes target" (which conflicted with hexproof) to "whenever a counter is removed." Now Redistribute and counter-removal effects can break its protection, creating counterplay with set mechanics.
