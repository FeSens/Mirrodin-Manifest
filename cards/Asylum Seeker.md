# Asylum Seeker

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Citizen

## Rules Text
> Asylum Seeker enters the battlefield with a hope counter on it.
>
> As long as Asylum Seeker has a hope counter on it, it has hexproof and "Whenever this creature is dealt damage, put a +1/+1 counter on it."
>
> When Asylum Seeker becomes the target of a spell or ability an opponent controls, remove all hope counters from it.

## Flavor Text
> *"I came seeking safety. I found only waiting."*

## Image Prompt
> Asylum Seeker, Human Citizen from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Mer-Ikan Foundry — sterile processing center with endless queues. Mood: Exhaustion. Pose: Seated at processing desk, papers clutched tightly, staring at numbered ticket. Key visual elements: Faint golden hope counter glowing on chest, iron-veined skin showing wear, eyes holding last flicker of light. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Rebecca Guay. Color palette: Golds, bronze, faded white, institutional gray.

## Design Notes
- Hope counter provides protection
- Grows from adversity (+1/+1 from damage)
- Loses hope when targeted (system breaks you)
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles hope = more resilience, [[Market Crash]] removes all hope
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - refugees seeking safety
- Pairs with: [[The Darksteel Wall]], [[Sanctuary City Warden]], [[DREAM Act Advocate]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Solemnity]] (can't lose hope counter - permanent hexproof!), [[The Ozolith]] (saves counters when dies), [[Hardened Scales]] (more +1/+1 counters from damage)
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Solemnity]] + Asylum Seeker creates a permanent hexproof creature that can never lose its hope counter!
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN - With Solemnity, this becomes an unkillable hexproof creature for 2 mana that grows when dealt damage. The "targeted" clause is bypassed entirely. Consider changing to "leaves the battlefield" or "when dealt damage by an opponent."
