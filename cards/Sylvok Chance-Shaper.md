# Sylvok Chance-Shaper

## Card Type Line
Creature — Elf Shaman

## Rules Text
> Whenever you gamble, you may pay {G}. If you do, scry 1 before revealing your top card. *(To gamble, you and target opponent each reveal the top card of your libraries. Whoever reveals the card with greater mana value wins.)*

## Flavor Text
> *"The Tangle teaches patience. Patience teaches when to leap."*

## Image Prompt
> Sylvok Chance-Shaper, Elf Shaman from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Tangle — copper trees with falling metallic leaves creating pattern. Mood: Grim determination. Pose: Kneeling among falling leaves, reading their patterns before a gamble decision, hands raised to catch fortune's signs. Key visual elements: Green skin with copper-traced veins, hair of fine metallic filaments, leaves frozen mid-fall forming scry pattern. Style reference: Rebecca Guay. Color palette: Copper, forest green, olive, gold leaf highlights.

## Design Notes
- Green uncommon creature - addresses Green uncommon gap (-13, critical!)
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] synergy - Green's angle on gamble manipulation
- Scry before gamble is the key synergy (like [[The House Edge]] but repeatable for {G})
- Pairs with [[Fortune's Gardener]], [[Opportunistic Growth]], [[Wild Growth Gambit]]
- Green as secondary color for Gamble (after Red)

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Krark's Thumb]] combined scry + Thumb = near-guaranteed wins; [[Crystal Ball]]/[[Sensei's Divining Top]] stack the deck before gambling; [[Chance Encounter]] adds luck counters per win
- **Potential Combos:** [[Mirri's Guile]] know top cards before deciding to pay for scry; [[Future Sight]] see top card, scry if needed for better gambles; Enables consistent gamble wins when paired with top-deck manipulation
- **Balance Assessment:** Balanced - 3 mana 2/3, requires additional mana per gamble for the scry
