# Citizen Uprising

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Citizen creatures you control become 3/3 Soldiers until end of turn and gain haste and first strike.
>
> Create two 1/1 white Citizen creature tokens, then Citizen creatures you control deal damage equal to their power to target creature or planeswalker.

## Flavor Text
> *"We were refugees. Now we are revolutionaries."*

## Image Prompt
> Citizen Uprising — Sorcery. Action depicted: A mass of Citizen refugees transforming into soldiers mid-charge, improvised weapons raised. Setting: Mer-Ikan Foundry gates, furnace flames illuminating from behind. Focal point: Lead refugee's face shifting from fear to fury. Mood: Genuine hope. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Rebecca Guay.

## Design Notes
- **Citizen tribal payoff** - turns tokens into real threats
- Connects: [[War Refugee Camp]], [[Civilian Militia]], [[Hidden Community Elder]], [[Sanctuary City Warden]]
- Creates Citizens then immediately buffs them
- Boros (R/W) - aggressive resistance theme
- Pairs with [[Zel-Ensk, the Resilient Spark]], [[Sanctuary Manifest]]
- Token synergy for go-wide strategies
- The oppressed fight back

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Civic Saber]] equipped creature gets +1/+1 for each color; [[Intangible Virtue]] tokens get +1/+1 and vigilance; [[Anointed Procession]] doubles Citizen token creation
- **Potential Combos:** [[Cathars' Crusade]] each Citizen entering gives all creatures +1/+1 counters; [[Impact Tremors]] each token deals 1 damage to opponents; [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]] tokens deal 2 damage each
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Token creation plus temporary buff is appropriately costed at 4 mana. The damage ability is useful but not broken
