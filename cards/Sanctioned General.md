# Sanctioned General

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Soldier

## Rules Text
> Sanctioned General enters the battlefield with three sanction counters on it.
>
> Sanctioned General has menace and deathtouch as long as it has no sanction counters on it.
>
> At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a sanction counter from Sanctioned General and you lose 2 life.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Synod's sanctions mean nothing. We have the Vault's gold."*

## Image Prompt
> Sanctioned General, Human Soldier from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Dross Dominion war room — dark chamber with piled unread documents stamped "SANCTIONED." Mood: Corrupted triumph turning to desperation. Pose: Seated at a darksteel desk counting gold coins, ignoring the pressure closing in. Key visual elements: Decorated uniform corroding at the edges, chrome-plated skull showing through thinning skin, sanction counters manifesting as binding chains of light. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Near-black, gold, rust, decaying bronze.

## Design Notes
- Sanction counters represent international pressure
- Loses counters over time (sanctions wear off or are bypassed)
- Gains power when unsanctioned
- Life loss = economic damage from sanctions
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] can double sanction counters, prolonging weakness
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Deep-Sik Collective (DeepSeek / Chinese AI)]] - [[The Sanctions War]]
- Pairs with: [[Put-In, the Iron Despot]], [[The Sanctions War]], [[Nim Occupation Force]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Solemnity]] (enters with no counters, immediately has menace and deathtouch, no life loss), [[Vampire Hexmage]] (remove all counters instantly), [[Aether Snap]] (remove all counters from all permanents), [[Thief of Blood]] (remove counters and get huge)
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Solemnity]] + Sanctioned General (2BB for a 3/3 menace deathtouch with no downside whatsoever - extremely pushed for 4 mana)
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN with Solemnity - Without Solemnity, this is fair (costs 6 life total, delayed power). WITH Solemnity, this is a 4-mana 3/3 menace deathtouch which is above rate but requires a specific combo piece.
