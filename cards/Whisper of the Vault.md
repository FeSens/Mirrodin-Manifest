# Whisper of the Vault

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Target player discards a card. You gain 1 life.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Black Ledger knows your secrets. All of them."*

## Image Prompt
> A shadowy figure whispering into a victim's ear, dark tendrils extracting memories.

## Design Notes
- Black common instant - addresses Black common gap (-6)
- Hand disruption with minor lifegain
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Lore connection: [[Lore#Ep-Styn's Silent Isle (Epstein)]]
- Pairs with: [[The Black Ledger]], [[Vault Shadow-Broker]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Megrim]] opponent discarding deals 2 damage; [[Liliana's Caress]] another discard = damage effect; [[Waste Not]] generates value from opponent discards; [[Tinybones, Trinket Thief]] draws cards when opponents discard
- **Potential Combos:** [[Nekusar, the Mindrazer]] wheel decks mass discard damage; [[The Rack]]/[[Shrieking Affliction]] 8-Rack archetype synergy; [[Tergrid, God of Fright]] steals discarded cards
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Standard discard spell with minor lifegain. Synergizes with discard archetypes but not broken
