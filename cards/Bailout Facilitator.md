## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Advisor

## Flavor Text
> *"Too big to fail. Too connected to punish."*

## Image Prompt
> Bailout Facilitator, Human Advisor from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Mer-Ikan Foundry — government presentation chamber, officials seated in tiers. Mood: False promise. Pose: Standing proudly beside restored construct, arms gesturing to its gleaming form. Key visual elements: Pristine white and blue robes, chrome-capped fingers, gold flowing from taxpayer coffers into the machine, workers visible in dismay below. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: White chrome, steel blue, gold streams.

## Design Notes
- Reanimates artifact creatures (corporate bailout)
- Adds +1/+1 counters (government support)
- Becomes treasure (public money)
- Sacrifice for cards (liquidation)
- Treasure synergy enables sacrifice loops
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Great Doubt (The AI Hype Correction)]] - corporate rescues
- Pairs with: [[Quantitative Easer]], [[Hedge Fund Manager]], [[Trickle-Down Theorist]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Wurmcoil Engine]] (prime reanimation target), [[Academy Ruins]] (loops artifact creatures), [[Panharmonicon]] (double the reanimation trigger)
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** Bailout Facilitator + [[Ashnod's Altar]] + [[Myr Retriever]] + 2nd Retriever/[[Junk Diver]] (infinite ETB/death triggers, infinite mana - Retrievers return each other), Infinite with [[Sharuum the Hegemon]] clones if you add flickering
- **Balance Assessment:** FIXED - Added mana value 3 or less restriction (prevents reanimating Wurmcoil Engine, etc.), removed +1/+1 counters, increased draw activation to {3}. Still powerful synergy piece but no longer overwhelming value.
