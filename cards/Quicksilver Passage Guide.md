# Quicksilver Passage Guide

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Rogue

## Rules Text
> {U}, {T}: Target creature you control gains hexproof until end of turn and can't be exiled this turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"Across the Sea, past the checkpoints. I know the way."*

## Image Prompt
> Quicksilver Passage Guide, Human Rogue from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Quicksilver Sea at night — mercury waves reflecting patrol thopter searchlights. Mood: Suspicion. Pose: Crouched and guiding refugees through shallow quicksilver, one hand raised for silence. Key visual elements: Hooded cloak with chrome threading, iron-veined hands, refugees with metallic bone protrusions visible. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Deep blue, silver, moonlit chrome.

## Design Notes
- Grants exile protection (coyote/smuggler)
- Clone effect for disguise (false papers)
- Helps immigrants evade Mer-Ikan
- Blue trickery/evasion
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - smugglers helping refugees
- Pairs with: [[Mephidross Refugee]], [[Tunneling Hopeful]], [[Sanctuary City Warden]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Flicker effects ([[Thassa, Deep-Dwelling]], [[Restoration Angel]]) - protect from your own exile effects (odd interaction). [[Swords to Plowshares]] / [[Path to Exile]] (opponent's removal fizzles). [[Spark Double]] (copy your best creature)
- **Potential Combos:** Clone your ETB creatures (copy [[Mulldrifter]], draw 2, etc.). Copy legendary creatures - but legendary rule would apply, both die unless one is non-legendary copy
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - The "can't be exiled" is narrow but useful against specific removal. The clone ability is temporary and costs 2 mana + tap. Neither ability is broken. The combination is flexible and flavorful.
