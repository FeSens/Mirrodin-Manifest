# Family Separation Agent

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Soldier Mer-Ikan

## Rules Text
> When Family Separation Agent enters the battlefield, exile target creature an opponent controls with mana value 2 or less until Family Separation Agent leaves the battlefield.

## Flavor Text
> *"The child goes to processing. The parent goes... elsewhere."*

## Image Prompt
> Family Separation Agent, Human Soldier Mer-Ikan from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Great Furnace/Mer-Ikan Foundry — sterile processing corridor. Mood: Institutional horror. Pose: Standing between two creatures, arms pushing them apart as they reach for each other. Key visual elements: Cold iron-veined face showing no emotion, white-and-black uniform of bureaucratic enforcement, desperate reaching hands behind. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Kev Walker. Color palette: White uniform, black accents, bronze skin tones on separated figures.

## Design Notes
- Exiles small creatures (children/vulnerable)
- When it leaves, opponent finds a "family member"
- Orzhov institutional cruelty
- Mechanically represents family separation
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - family separation policy
- Pairs with: [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[Detention Warden]], [[Reprocessing Agent]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Phyrexian Tower]] (sacrifice after exiling to give opponent a tutor), Wrath effects (mass removal returns creature AND gives tutor), [[Oblivion Ring]] style effects (chain exiles), [[Solitude]] (both exile small creatures in W/B)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - The "family reunion" tutor is a clever design that gives opponents compensation. Well-balanced.
