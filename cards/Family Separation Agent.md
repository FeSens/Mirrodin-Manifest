# Family Separation Agent

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Soldier Mer-Ikan

## Rules Text
> When Family Separation Agent enters the battlefield, exile target creature an opponent controls with mana value 2 or less.
>
> When Family Separation Agent leaves the battlefield, the exiled creature's owner may search their library for a creature card that shares a creature type with it, reveal it, and put it into their hand. Then they shuffle.

## Flavor Text
> *"The child goes to processing. The parent goes... elsewhere."*

## Image Prompt
> A cold-eyed agent physically separating two creatures who reach for each other. The scene is clinical, heartbreaking. Institutional cruelty.

## Design Notes
- Exiles small creatures (children/vulnerable)
- When it leaves, opponent finds a "family member"
- Orzhov institutional cruelty
- Mechanically represents family separation
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - family separation policy
- Pairs with: [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[Detention Warden]], [[Reprocessing Agent]]
