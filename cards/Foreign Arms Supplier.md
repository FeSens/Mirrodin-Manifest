# Foreign Arms Supplier

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Artificer

## Rules Text
> When Foreign Arms Supplier enters the battlefield, create an Equipment artifact token with "Equipped creature gets +2/+0 and has first strike" and equip {1}.
>
> Whenever you create an Equipment token, put a supply counter on Foreign Arms Supplier. It gets +0/+1 for each supply counter on it.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Synod sends weapons, not soldiers. Make them count."*

## Image Prompt
> A human artificer unloading crates of weapons from a transport, Leonin soldiers eagerly receiving them. Aid from abroad.

## Design Notes
- Creates Equipment tokens (foreign aid)
- Counter synergy: Supply counters track aid sent, [[Hype Cycle]] doubles them, [[COMPOUND]] adds more
- Supports Equipment synergy
- Western arms support theme
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - foreign aid to Zel-Ensk
- Pairs with: [[Zel-Ensk, the Resilient Spark]], [[Watchtower Defender]], [[Drone Strike Operator]]
