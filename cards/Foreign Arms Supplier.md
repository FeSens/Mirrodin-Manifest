# Foreign Arms Supplier

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Artificer

## Rules Text
> When Foreign Arms Supplier enters the battlefield, create an Equipment artifact token with "Equipped creature gets +2/+0 and has first strike" and equip {1}.
>
> Whenever you create an Equipment token, put a supply counter on Foreign Arms Supplier. It gets +0/+1 for each supply counter on it.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Synod sends weapons, not soldiers. Make them count."*

## Image Prompt
> Foreign Arms Supplier, Human Artificer from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Great Furnace/Mer-Ikan Foundry — supply depot at border. Mood: Grim determination. Pose: Unloading weapon crates from transport, handing them to eager Leonin soldiers. Key visual elements: Iron-veined arms lifting chrome weapons, supply counters glowing on crates, Leonin soldiers in background receiving arms. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: White, gold crates, bronze accents, chrome weapons.

## Design Notes
- Creates Equipment tokens (foreign aid)
- Counter synergy: Supply counters track aid sent, [[Hype Cycle]] doubles them, [[COMPOUND]] adds more
- Supports Equipment synergy
- Western arms support theme
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - foreign aid to Zel-Ensk
- Pairs with: [[Zel-Ensk, the Resilient Spark]], [[Watchtower Defender]], [[Drone Strike Operator]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Puresteel Paladin]] (free equips + card draw), [[Sigarda's Aid]] (flash equip), [[Sram, Senior Edificer]] (draw on equipment creation), [[Kemba, Kha Regent]] (equipment token synergy)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Good equipment support card. Grows defensively as you create more equipment.
