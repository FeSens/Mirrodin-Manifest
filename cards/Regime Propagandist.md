# Regime Propagandist

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Advisor

## Rules Text
> {T}: Put a narrative counter on target creature you control. It gains lifelink until end of turn.
>
> Creatures you control with narrative counters on them can't be sacrificed.

## Flavor Text
> *"Heroes never fall. Traitors are never remembered."*

## Image Prompt
> Regime Propagandist, Human Advisor from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Vault of Whispers broadcast chamber — dark with holographic projectors. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Pose: Arms raised theatrically, projecting a heroic hologram that flickers to reveal darker truth beneath. Key visual elements: Elaborate black and gold robes, chrome skull plating visible at temples, narrative counters floating like fireflies around the propaganda image. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Near-black, dark olive, deceptive gold.

## Design Notes
- Narrative counters = controlling the story
- Grants keywords (spinning narratives)
- Protection from sacrifice effects (can't be removed by "investigations")
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles narrative counters, [[COMPOUND]] adds
- Orzhov propaganda machine
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - regime propaganda
- Pairs with: [[Put-In, the Iron Despot]], [[Control The Narrative]], [[Synod High Chancellor]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Doubling Season]] / [[Hardened Scales]] (double narrative counters for faster protection), [[Cathars' Crusade]] (adding +1/+1 counters alongside narrative counters), [[Mikaeus, the Unhallowed]] (recursion with deathtouch from propagandist), [[Kaya, Orzhov Usurper]] (works well in sacrifice-resistant strategies)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Narrow protection, requires tap to activate, reasonable cost.
