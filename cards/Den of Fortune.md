## Image Prompt
> Den of Fortune — Glimmervoid. Time of day: Artificial twilight, neon-like glow from gold fixtures. Vantage point: Looking down into the den from a shadowed balcony. Key features: Gambling tables surrounded by desperate players, gold tokens piled high, chrome dice mid-roll. Mood: False promise. Style reference: John Avon meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Gold, white light, deep shadows.

## Design Notes
- **Gamble archetype land** - mana support for gamble decks
- Connects: [[All-In Gambler]], [[Gambling with the Devil]], [[Gambler's Instinct]], [[Lucky Strike]], [[Reckless Gambit]], [[Jackpot Wurm]], [[Tangle Titan]]
- Mana for gamble spells + gamble activation
- Risk/reward mana ability
- Pairs with: [[Den of Chance]], [[Fortune's Favor]], [[The House Edge]], [[Calculated Risk]]
- Enables dedicated Gamble archetype

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Untap effects ([[Deserted Temple]], [[Candelabra of Tawnos]]) for multiple gamble attempts, [[Krark, the Thumbless]] (coin flip synergies), [[Chance Encounter]] (win condition with coin flips)
- **Potential Combos:** With [[Krark's Thumb]] (if gamble is coin-based): Heavily weighted odds. With [[Deserted Temple]] + [[Rings of Brighthearth]]: Multiple gamble attempts per turn.
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - 50/50 gamble for mana is reasonable. Average EV is slightly negative (1.5R - 1 damage = roughly break-even over time).
