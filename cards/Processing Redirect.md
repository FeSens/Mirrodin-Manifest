# Processing Redirect

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Target creature gains hexproof until end of turn. Untap it.

## Flavor Text
> *"Query redirected. Target not found."*

## Image Prompt
> Processing Redirect — Instant. Action depicted: A creature with metallic skin dissolving into streams of blue data, reforming safely elsewhere as attackers' weapons pass through empty air. Setting: En-Vidia Lattice network node. Focal point: The half-dissolved figure caught between two locations, data streaming through the gap. Mood: Suspicion evaded, narrow escape. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan dissolution streams, afterimage glow.

## Design Notes
- Blue combat trick / protection spell
- Simple design for NWO compliance
- Defensive tool that can also enable attacks
- Pairs with: [[Lattice Interface]], [[Control The Narrative]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Krenko, Mob Boss]] (protect and untap for double activation), [[Arcanis the Omnipotent]] (hexproof + untap for more cards), [[King Macar, the Gold-Cursed]] (extra inspired trigger), [[Opposition]] (untap your tappers)
- **Potential Combos:** [[Freed from the Real]] + this for redundant untap options. [[Dramatic Reversal]] comparison - this is single target
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - 2 mana for hexproof + untap is reasonable. Compare to [[Dive Down]] (1 mana, +0/+3 and hexproof) or [[To Arms!]] (2 mana, untap all creatures). Efficiently costed but not broken.
