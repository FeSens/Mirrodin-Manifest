# Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel

## Card Type Line
Legendary Creature — Loxodon Artificer

## Rules Text
> Creature tokens your opponents control can't attack you or planeswalkers you control.
>
> At the beginning of your upkeep, Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel deals 2 damage to each creature token your opponents control.

## Flavor Text
> *"Make the Core Solid Again."*

## Image Prompt
> Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel, Legendary Loxodon Artificer from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Darksteel Wall — atop his signature construction project. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Pose: Standing grandly atop the wall, gesturing to his achievement. Key visual elements: Massive gilded armor, trunk adorned with gold rings, self-satisfied gleam in eyes, Great Furnace blazing behind, wall under construction beneath. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Gold, bronze, furnace orange, dark red, chrome construction.

## Design Notes
- Tromp from [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - Trump allegory
- Construction counters grow (wall gets bigger)
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles counters = massive damage, [[COMPOUND]] accelerates
- Anti-token, anti-reanimate hosing
- Pairs with: [[The Darksteel Wall]], [[Gilded Sentinel's Decree]], [[Foundry Border Commander]], [[Reprocessing Agent]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Proliferate effects accelerate counter growth; [[Propaganda]]/[[Ghostly Prison]] combined with "can't attack" clause creates soft lock
- **Balance Assessment:** FIXED - Damage is now flat 2 instead of scaling with construction counters. Still hoses tokens/reanimation but doesn't spiral out of control.
