# Grove of Equal Measure

## Card Type Line
Land

## Rules Text
> Grove of Equal Measure enters the battlefield tapped.
>
> {T}: Add {G} or {W}.
>
> {2}, {T}: Redistribute between two target permanents you control. *(To redistribute, remove all counters from both, then put half that many counters, rounded down, on each of them of the types removed this way.)*

## Flavor Text
> *"In this grove, no tree grows taller than its neighbor."*

## Image Prompt
> Grove of Equal Measure — The Tangle. Time of day: Golden hour, diffused light filtering through canopy. Vantage point: Eye-level, standing at the grove's entrance. Key features: Copper trees trimmed to identical heights, perfectly uniform spacing, redistribution runes carved into bark. Mood: Unsettling peace, enforced equality. Style reference: John Avon meets Rebecca Guay. Color palette: Copper, forest green, golden light, white mist.

## Design Notes
- GW land - addresses mana fixing needs (Priority 4)
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] synergy - land-based redistribution
- Selesnya colors (forced equality themes)
- Enters tapped for balance
- Pairs with [[Tangle Reclaimer]], [[Nature's Rebalancing]]
- Useful utility land for counter decks

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Hardened Scales]]/[[Winding Constrictor]]/[[Conclave Mentor]] offset redistribution losses; [[The Ozolith]] stores counters before redistribution; [[Doubling Season]]/[[Corpsejack Menace]] doubles counters placed during redistribution
- **Potential Combos:** [[Animation Module]] generates servo tokens when counters are redistributed; [[Devoted Druid]] redistribute -1/-1 counters away to reset; [[Kitchen Finks]]/Persist creatures - remove -1/-1 counters for more death triggers
- **Balance Assessment:** Balanced - enters tapped, costs 2 to activate, rounding down loses counters
