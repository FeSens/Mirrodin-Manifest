# Redaction-Myr

## Card Type Line
Artifact Creature — Myr

## Rules Text
> {T}: Exile target card from a graveyard. Put a redaction counter on Redaction-Myr.
>
> {2}, {T}, Remove two redaction counters from Redaction-Myr: Counter target activated or triggered ability.

## Flavor Text
> *"What records? There were never any records."*

## Image Prompt
> Redaction-Myr, Myr from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Vault of Whispers archive — endless shelves of chrome tablets in darkness. Mood: Institutional horror. Pose: Methodically scratching names from tablets with ink-stained appendages. Key visual elements: Black ink dripping from chrome fingers, piles of redacted documents, single glowing eye illuminating its grim work. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Near-black, dark olive, faint necrogen glow.

## Design Notes
- References the Redaction-Myr from [[Lore#The Great Ep-Styn Mystery]]
- Exiles evidence from graveyards
- Counter synergy: Redaction counters synergize with [[Hype Cycle]] and [[COMPOUND]]
- Cover-up mechanic for Ep-Styn theme
- Pairs with: [[The Black Ledger]], [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]], [[Archive Scrubbing]], [[Control The Narrative]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Proliferate effects (add more redaction counters), [[The Ozolith]] (store counters), [[Opposition Agent]] (legendary card, but activated abilities), [[Urza, Lord High Artificer]] (counter his activated ability)
- **Potential Combos:** Against [[Thrasios, Triton Hero]]/[[Tymna the Weaver]] Commander decks: exile their graveyard, counter their commander abilities. With [[Strionic Resonator]] (copy the exile trigger... but it's an activated ability, not triggered)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Very narrow application (only legendary sources for counters, only legendary abilities for the counter effect). Requires setup (2 legendary cards in graveyard + mana). Solid hate piece but not broken.
