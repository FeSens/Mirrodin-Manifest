## Image Prompt
> Displaced Worker, Human from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Great Furnace/Mer-Ikan Foundry — outside chrome factory gates. Mood: Buried rage. Pose: Standing defeated, holding termination notice, watching through window as Myr replace them. Key visual elements: Iron-veined hands crumpling notice, chrome factory behind, tiny inefficient Myr visible through window. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Rebecca Guay. Color palette: White notice, bronze factory, gold and dark red accents.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** The 50,000+ workers laid off with AI cited as the reason; the "AI-washing" phenomenon
- **Lore:** Beings across Mirrodin displaced by supposed automation
- ETB creates a Myr if opponent has more artifacts—you get your "replacement"
- Sacrifice artifact for power boost represents rage against the machines
- White for the working class, community, and displaced labor
- Common because this is happening everywhere
- Pairs with: [[Optimization Lie]], [[Trough of Disillusionment]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Treasure tokens / artifact token generators (fuel for pump), [[Cranial Plating]] (already in artifact deck), [[Shrapnel Blast]] (sacrifice synergies)
- **Potential Combos:** [[Dross Scorpion]] + [[Krark-Clan Ironworks]]: Sacrifice Myr for mana, untap Dross Scorpion, but need death trigger creatures. Not broken with just this card.
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Solid common for artifact strategies.
