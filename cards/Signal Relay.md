# Signal Relay

## Card Type Line
Artifact

## Rules Text
> {T}, Sacrifice Signal Relay: Scry 2.

## Flavor Text
> *"A brief message. An endless consequence."*

## Image Prompt
> Signal Relay — Artifact. Visual focus: A small chrome device pulsing with cyan energy as it dissolves into data streams. Setting: En-Vidia Lattice relay station, conduits carrying information in all directions. Mood: False promise of connection. Key visual elements: Antenna array folding into light, data streams spiraling outward, the device's core flickering its last transmission. Style reference: Mark Tedin. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan pulse.

## Design Notes
- Colorless common artifact - addresses Colorless common gap (-6)
- Sacrifice for scry synergizes with [[🎲 GAMBLE]]
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Cheap artifact for artifact synergies
- Pairs with: [[Surveillance Myr]], [[Data Collector]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Mirrodin Besieged]] (sacrifice artifacts for Besieged triggers), [[Glissa, the Traitor]] (return on creature death), [[Emry, Lurker of the Loch]] (recast from graveyard), [[Teshar, Ancestor's Apostle]] (historic triggers)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Clean common design. Scry 2 for 1 mana + tap + sacrifice is appropriately costed.
