# Myr-Sourced Automation

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> When Myr-Sourced Automation enters the battlefield, create two 1/1 colorless Myr artifact creature tokens.
>
> Once each turn, whenever you cast a noncreature spell, you may tap an untapped Myr you control. If you do, copy that spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.
>
> Non-Myr creatures you control get -1/-1.

## Flavor Text
> *"Efficiency requires displacement."*
> — Core-Logic Directive 7.1

## Image Prompt
> Myr-Sourced Automation — Enchantment. Visual focus: A factory floor where synchronized Myr units perform tasks flawlessly while organic workers with chrome-bones visible under skin stand idle, their tools rusting. Setting: En-Vidia Lattice industrial sector. Mood: Institutional horror, displacement. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan displays, warm flesh tones fading to gray obsolescence.

## Design Notes
- Creates Myr tokens for value
- Myr enable spell copying (AI automation)
- **Counter synergy:** -1/-1 counters accumulate on non-Myr (organic displacement)
- [[Hype Cycle]] doubles -1/-1 counters → faster death, but Chapter III removes them!
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] can spread the -1/-1 counters to Myr (unionization?)
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - The Myr-Mind automating labor, displacing organic workers
- Build-around for Myr tribal / spellslinger hybrid

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Paradox Engine]] (banned) untaps all nonlands with each spell; [[Niv-Mizzet, Parun]] draw from copies deals damage; [[Thousand-Year Storm]] stacks copy effects
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Intruder Alarm]] untaps Myr when tokens enter = copy more spells infinitely; [[High Tide]] + cantrips = storm off with free copies; [[Dramatic Reversal]] + [[Isochron Scepter]] = infinite copies
- **Balance Assessment:** FIXED - Added "once each turn" limit to prevent storm abuse. Still powerful but no longer broken with infinite combos.
