## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Citizen

## Rules Text
> {T}: Add {G}. If this mana is spent on a creature spell, that creature enters the battlefield with an additional +1/+1 counter on it.

## Flavor Text

## Image Prompt
> Undocumented Worker, Human Citizen from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Great Furnace — worker forge area, official eyes elsewhere. Mood: Exhaustion. Pose: Tending to a gleaming forge with tired but skilled hands. Key visual elements: Simple worn clothes, iron-veined hands creating something beautiful, precarious glances toward official areas, essential work rendered invisible. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Rebecca Guay. Color palette: Copper, forest green worker clothing, furnace orange, muted dignity.

## Design Notes
- Mana dork that improves creatures
- Can't block deportation forces
- Represents immigrant labor contribution
- Green growth/work ethic
- Counter synergy: Creates +1/+1 counters that synergize with [[Hype Cycle]] and [[COMPOUND]]
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - undocumented labor
- Pairs with: [[Hidden Community Elder]], [[Sanctuary City Warden]], [[Foundry Citizenship]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Hardened Scales]], [[Winding Constrictor]], creature-heavy decks
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Conditional [[Llanowar Elves]] with bonus is reasonable
