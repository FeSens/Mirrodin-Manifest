# Hedge Fund Manager

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Advisor

## Rules Text
> When Hedge Fund Manager enters the battlefield, create three Gold tokens.
>
> Whenever you sacrifice a Gold token, Gamble. If you win the gamble, create two Gold tokens.
>
> At the beginning of your end step, sacrifice a Gold token.

## Flavor Text
> *"Risk is just opportunity in disguise."*

## Image Prompt
> A confident figure surrounded by floating gold tokens, some multiplying, some vanishing. Charts and graphs swirl around them. High finance.

## Design Notes
- Creates Gold (capital)
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] on sacrifice = leveraged bets
- Must sacrifice each turn = fees/losses
- Win = exponential growth, synergizes with [[COMPOUND]]
- Lose = capital destruction
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Glimmervoid Rally (Gold Rally)]] - high finance gambling
- Pairs with: [[The House Edge]], [[Bubble Speculator]], [[The Rigged Game]]
