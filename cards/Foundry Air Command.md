## Design Notes
- **Vehicle/Thopter commander** - makes vehicles better
- Connects: [[Night Stalker Thopter]], [[Glimmer-Barge]], [[Border Patrol Thopter]], [[Drone Strike Operator]]
- Crew 1 makes all vehicles easy to activate
- Attack trigger creates air force
- Boros (R/W) - military aggression theme
- Pairs with [[Foundry Strike Team]], [[Operation Absolute Resolve]], [[Sanctioned General]]
- Thopter synergy with artifact themes
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - military might

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Smuggler's Copter]] becomes crew 1 and enables looting; [[Parhelion II]] becomes crew 1, creates 4/4 Angels AND Thopters; [[Esika's Chariot]] crew 1, creates cats AND Thopters when attacking
- **POTENTIALLY BROKEN Combos:** [[Peacewalker Colossus]] can animate other vehicles, combined with crew 1 = vehicle army; [[Dermotaxi]] exile a creature, crew 1, becomes copy + makes Thopter; [[Surgehacker Mech]] crew 1, ETB damage scales with artifacts; [[Reckoner Bankbuster]] crew 1 card draw engine that also makes Thopters
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN - Crew 1 on ALL vehicles is very powerful. Combined with Thopter generation on vehicle attacks, this creates exponential board presence. Smuggler's Copter was banned partially due to how easy it was to crew. This makes EVERY vehicle that easy to crew while adding free tokens. Consider adding "nontoken" restriction or increasing crew cost reduction
