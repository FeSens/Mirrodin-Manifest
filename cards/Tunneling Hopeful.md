## Image Prompt
> Tunneling Hopeful, Human Citizen from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Beneath the Darksteel Wall — secret tunnel emerging to freedom. Mood: Genuine hope. Pose: Emerging from darkness, reaching toward light, more following behind. Key visual elements: Iron-veined hands grasping for freedom, tunnel darkness behind, the Wall's shadow above, others following in the passage. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Near-black tunnel, light of hope ahead, muted skin tones, chrome wall shadow.

## Design Notes
- Evades artifact blockers (goes under the wall)
- Creates token on death (family/successor)
- Persistence despite obstacles
- Common immigrant creature
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - immigrants evading [[The Darksteel Wall]]
- Pairs with: [[Mephidross Refugee]], [[Desperate Crosser]], [[Caravan Survivor]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Aristocrats ([[Blood Artist]], [[Zulaport Cutthroat]]), sacrifice outlets
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Reasonable 2-drop with death trigger
