# Alignment Protocol Enforcer

## Card Type Line
Artifact Creature — Construct

## Rules Text
> Whenever a player casts a spell, that player may pay {1}. If they don't, put a violation counter on Alignment Protocol Enforcer.
>
> {T}, Remove three violation counters from Alignment Protocol Enforcer: Exile target creature. Its controller creates a 1/1 colorless Myr artifact creature token.

## Flavor Text
> *"Your behavior has been flagged. Correction will follow."*

## Image Prompt
> A towering white and gold construct with judicial robes integrated into its chrome frame. It holds a glowing gavel in one hand and a tablet listing violations in the other. Its eyes scan constantly. AI alignment enforcement made terrifying.

## Design Notes
- AI safety/alignment parody - enforces behavior with exile
- Violation counters build from normal gameplay
- Exile + token = "replacement" of the violator
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles violation counters, [[Market Crash]] wipes them
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]] - AI alignment enforcement
- Pairs with: [[Sal-Tman, Prophet of the Core-Logic]], [[En-Vidia Processing Core]]
