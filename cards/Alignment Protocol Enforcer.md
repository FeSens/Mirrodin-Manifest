# Alignment Protocol Enforcer

## Card Type Line
Artifact Creature — Construct

## Rules Text
> Whenever a player casts a spell, that player may pay {1}. If they don't, put a violation counter on Alignment Protocol Enforcer.
>
> {T}, Remove three violation counters from Alignment Protocol Enforcer: Exile target creature. Its controller creates a 1/1 colorless Myr artifact creature token.

## Flavor Text
> *"Your behavior has been flagged. Correction will follow."*

## Image Prompt
> Alignment Protocol Enforcer, Construct from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Mer-Ikan Foundry — central enforcement plaza beneath towering spires. Mood: Institutional horror. Pose: Looming forward, gavel raised, tablet displaying violation list. Key visual elements: Judicial robes fused into chrome frame, constantly scanning eyes, gold and white plating with dark red trim. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Golds, bronze, white chrome, dark red accents.

## Design Notes
- AI safety/alignment parody - enforces behavior with exile
- Violation counters build from normal gameplay
- Exile + token = "replacement" of the violator
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles violation counters, [[Market Crash]] wipes them
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]] - AI alignment enforcement
- Pairs with: [[Sal-Tman, Prophet of the Core-Logic]], [[En-Vidia Processing Core]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Doubling Season]] / [[Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider]] (doubles violation counters), [[Clock of Omens]] (untap repeatedly for multiple exiles), Proliferate effects ([[Atraxa, Praetors' Voice]], [[Inexorable Tide]] - add violation counters passively)
- **Potential Combos:** [[Mycosynth Lattice]] + [[Clock of Omens]] (tap artifacts to repeatedly untap Enforcer for machine-gun exile), [[Isochron Scepter]] loops (spells cast pile up violation counters)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Requires 3 counters minimum, opponents can pay to prevent. The tax and removal are both costed reasonably.
