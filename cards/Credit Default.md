# Credit Default

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Counter target spell unless its controller creates a [[Debt Token|Debt token]] or pays {3}.

## Flavor Text
> *"Your future is collateral."*

## Image Prompt
> Credit Default — Instant. Action depicted: A Vedalken bureaucrat slamming a glowing "DENIED" stamp down, contract chains wrapping around a spell mid-cast. Setting: En-Vidia Lattice — administrative checkpoint. Focal point: The moment of choice where spell meets debt chains. Mood: Institutional horror. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Nils Hamm.

## Design Notes
- Blue uncommon counterspell
- Opponent chooses: take debt or pay {3}
- Creates interesting decisions
- Soft counter with debt rider
- Addresses Blue uncommon gap
- Pairs with: [[Debt Accumulator]], [[Economic Warfare]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Debt Ceiling (in set) - If opponent takes the Debt, they get 2 Debts each with 3 counters = 6 damage minimum; Default Cascade (in set) - Debt tokens can never truly be destroyed; [[Rhystic Study]] (similar taxing effects stack oppressively); [[Grand Arbiter Augustin IV]] (makes the {3} cost effectively {5})
- **Potential Combos:** No infinite combos, but in a Debt-focused deck, this is essentially "Counter target spell unless opponent takes 3+ damage"
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Comparable to Quench/Mana Leak variants. Opponent always has a choice.
