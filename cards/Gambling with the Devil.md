# Gambling with the Devil

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Gamble. *(You and target opponent reveal the top card of your libraries. Whoever reveals the card with greater mana value wins. If equal, the active player wins.)*
>
> The player who loses the gamble loses 6 life.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Golem at the table never blinks. He already knows your hand—he built the deck."*
> — Survivor of Ep-Styn's Isle

## Image Prompt
> Gambling with the Devil — Sorcery. Action depicted: A desperate human with chrome-laced skin seated across from a menacing iron golem at a metallic table, both revealing the top cards of glowing decks, the golem's hollow red eyes fixed on its prey. Setting: A private gambling den within Ep-Styn's Isle, molten gold reflections on every surface. Focal point: The revealed cards, life and death in the balance. Mood: False promise, institutional horror. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Deep reds, blacks, furnace orange, quicksilver reflections.

## Design Notes
- Mechanic: [[🎲 GAMBLE]]
- High risk, high reward - both players are in danger
- Symmetrical punishment creates political tension
- At 2 mana, this is an aggressive tempo play for red decks with high-curve strategies
- Lore connection: References the dark dealings on Ep-Styn's Private Isle where the powerful gambled with things far more valuable than gold
- The flavor evokes the rigged nature of the games played by the elite in the Quicksilver Sea

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Draco]] (16 CMC stacks your deck to win gambles), [[Emrakul, the Aeons Torn]] (15 CMC near-guarantee), [[Brainstorm]] effects (stack high CMC on top before gambling), [[Cruel Entertainment]] (force opponents to gamble against each other)
- **Potential Combos:** [[Draco]]/[[Emrakul, the Aeons Torn]] on top + Gambling with the Devil = Essentially {1}{R} deal 6 damage to opponent
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - While you can rig it, dealing 6 for 2 mana with setup is reasonable. Burn spells deal 3 for 1 mana without setup.
