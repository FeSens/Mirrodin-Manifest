# Counter Vulture

## Card Type Line
Creature — Bird

## Rules Text
> Flying
>
> Whenever a player redistributes, put a +1/+1 counter on Counter Vulture.

## Flavor Text
> *"Where equality is enforced, opportunity follows."*

## Image Prompt
> A chrome-feathered vulture circling above a redistribution ceremony, waiting to pick up the scraps of value lost in the rounding.

## Design Notes
- Black common creature - addresses Black common gap (-13)
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] synergy - Black profits from redistribution
- Flying evasion with growing threat
- +1/+1 counters synergize with [[Hype Cycle]] and [[COMPOUND]]
- Weaponized redistribution - Black's angle on the mechanic
- Pairs with [[Central Planner]], [[Mak-Ron, the Glass Orator]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Any redistribute effects - grows whenever anyone redistributes; [[Hardened Scales]] extra counter when it gets counters; [[Animation Module]] pay 1 to create servo when Counter Vulture grows
- **Potential Combos:** With multiple redistribute effects per turn, grows rapidly; [[Strionic Resonator]] copy the growth trigger; In multiplayer with many redistribute effects, becomes huge
- **Balance Assessment:** Balanced - 3 mana 2/2 flying, only grows from redistribute triggers
