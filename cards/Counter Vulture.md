# Counter Vulture

## Card Type Line
Creature — Bird

## Rules Text
> Flying
>
> Whenever a permanent is redistributed, put a +1/+1 counter on Counter Vulture.

## Flavor Text
> *"Where equality is enforced, opportunity follows."*

## Image Prompt
> Counter Vulture, Bird from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Dross Dominion — circling above a redistribution ceremony in the swamps. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Pose: Wings spread wide, descending toward scattered counters. Key visual elements: Chrome-plated feathers with necrogen glow, metallic talons, glowing +1/+1 counter fragments in grip. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: Near-black, dark olive, sickly green necrogen glow.

## Design Notes
- Black common creature - addresses Black common gap (-13)
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] synergy - Black profits from redistribution
- Flying evasion with growing threat
- +1/+1 counters synergize with [[Hype Cycle]] and [[COMPOUND]]
- Weaponized redistribution - Black's angle on the mechanic
- Pairs with [[Central Planner]], [[Mak-Ron, the Glass Orator]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Any redistribute effects - grows whenever anyone redistributes; [[Hardened Scales]] extra counter when it gets counters; [[Animation Module]] pay 1 to create servo when Counter Vulture grows
- **Potential Combos:** With multiple redistribute effects per turn, grows rapidly; [[Strionic Resonator]] copy the growth trigger; In multiplayer with many redistribute effects, becomes huge
- **Balance Assessment:** Balanced - 3 mana 2/2 flying, only grows from redistribute triggers
