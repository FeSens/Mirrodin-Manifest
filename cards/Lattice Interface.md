## Card Type Line
Artifact

## Rules Text
> Whenever you scry, you may pay {1}. If you do, draw a card, then discard a card.
>
> {2}, {T}: Scry 2.
>
> {U}, {T}: Target Vedalken creature gains hexproof until end of turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"The En-Vidia sees all. We merely interpret."*

## Image Prompt
> Lattice Interface — Artifact. Visual focus: A chrome interface terminal with cascading holographic displays, Vedalken hands dancing across data streams, scry-symbols cycling through possible futures. Setting: The Seat of the Synod, a primary access point to the En-Vidia Lattice. Mood: Cold efficiency, infinite connection. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan holographic light, white data-pulses.

## Design Notes
- **Vedalken/Lattice hub** - connects Blue utility cards
- Connects: [[Lattice Analyst]], [[Lattice Delay]], [[Lattice Infiltrator]], [[Lattice Overseer]], [[Data Collector]], [[Processing Queue]]
- Scry synergy with [[🎲 GAMBLE]], [[The House Edge]], [[Calculated Risk]]
- Card filtering for Blue
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]]
- Pairs with: [[En-Vidia Processing Core]], [[Synod High Chancellor]], [[Mak-Ron, the Glass Orator]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Works excellently with [[Elrond, Master of Healing]], [[Arwen Undomiel]], and other "whenever you scry" payoffs; [[The Temporal Anchor]] lets you cast top card for free when you scry; [[Eligeth, Crossroads Augur]] turns all scry into card draw
- **Potential Combos:** [[Retreat to Coralhelm]] + [[Ruin Ghost]] + a Plains = infinite scry/landfall; [[Sensei's Divining Top]] + scry = powerful card selection engine
- **Balance Assessment:** Well-balanced uncommon. The mana cost on the loot effect prevents abuse
