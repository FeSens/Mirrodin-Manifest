# Natural Economy

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> If a Debt token you control would cause you to lose life, you gain that much life instead.
>
> At the beginning of your end step, remove a debt counter from a Debt you control.

## Flavor Text
> *"The forest trades in sunlight, not promises."*

## Image Prompt
> Natural Economy — Enchantment. Visual focus: A serene Tangle grove where copper vines have overgrown and consumed a collapsed chrome bank structure, debt contracts dissolving into mulch. Setting: The Tangle, where nature rejects artificial systems. Mood: Genuine hope, natural reclamation. Style reference: Rebecca Guay meets Terese Nielsen. Color palette: Copper, forest green, olive, dissolving gold of former debts.

## Design Notes
- Green uncommon enchantment
- Passive debt protection (prevents Debt life loss entirely)
- Slowly reduces your debt counters
- Green's nature-based economy rejects artificial debt
- Strong hoser but only protects YOU
- Pairs with: [[Bankruptcy Filing]], [[Inflation Hedge]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Debt creation for yourself (completely nullifies downside), [[Solemnity]] (no counters means no debt damage - different approach), [[Spike Feeder]] / [[Kitchen Finks]] (life gain synergies)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Specific hoser card for the set's debt mechanic. Narrow but effective. Could enable "free" self-debt if any cards let you give yourself debt for benefit.
