# Mephidross Scavenger

## Card Type Line
Creature — Zombie

## Rules Text
> When Mephidross Scavenger enters the battlefield, each player mills two cards.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Dross feeds on what the living discard."*

## Image Prompt
> A rotting zombie crawling through the toxic swamps of Mephidross, collecting discarded memories and metal scraps.

## Design Notes
- Black common creature - addresses Black common gap (-6)
- Mill synergy for self-mill or opponent disruption
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Dross (Mephidross)]]
- Pairs with: [[Mephidross Refugee]], [[The Black Ledger]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Altar of the Brood]] mill triggers when creatures enter; [[Undead Alchemist]] mill creates Zombie tokens; [[Syr Konrad, the Grim]] triggers on mill and creature movement
- **Potential Combos:** [[Mesmeric Orb]] additional mill synergy; [[Bruvac the Grandiloquent]] doubles mill; [[Phenax, God of Deception]] tap creatures to mill
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Mill 2 for each player is minor. Helps graveyard strategies but not broken
