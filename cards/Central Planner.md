# Central Planner

## Card Type Line
Creature — Vedalken Advisor

## Rules Text
> At the beginning of your upkeep, you may redistribute among two creatures with +1/+1 counters on them. *(To redistribute, choose two permanents. Remove all counters from them, then each gets half that many counters, rounded down.)*

## Flavor Text
> *"Inequality is inefficiency. Inefficiency is unacceptable."*

## Image Prompt
> Central Planner, Vedalken Advisor from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: En-Vidia Lattice — sterile planning chamber with perfect symmetry. Mood: Institutional horror. Pose: Standing before a balance scale, adjusting counters with precise instruments. Key visual elements: Four blue arms each holding measuring tools, chrome-veined skin, counters being equalized on scale, cold blue lighting. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan, clinical white.

## Design Notes
- Forces [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] when inequality exists
- Anti-[[COMPOUND]], anti-accumulation - key tension in the mechanical triangle
- From [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] example cards
- Planned economy enforcer
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Deep-Sik Collective (DeepSeek / Chinese AI)]] - planned economy ideology
- Pairs with: [[Mak-Ron, the Glass Orator]], [[Austerity Minister]], [[Free Market Zealot]]
- **Restriction added:** Limited to +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters only to prevent breaking planeswalkers (loyalty counters) and sagas (lore counters), which would be too oppressive in cross-format play

## Cross-Format Interactions
| External Card | Interaction |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Solemnity** | With no counters on permanents, Central Planner never triggers |
| **Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider** | Vorinclex doubles your counters, Central Planner can equalize |
| **Doubling Season** | Creates massive counter inequality, good redistribution target |
| **Hardened Scales / Winding Constrictor** | Asymmetric counter growth, Central Planner equalizes |
| **Poison Counters** | Does NOT affect poison (counters on players, not permanents) |

**Format Assessment:**
- **Commander**: Useful political tool for creature-based counter strategies
- **Modern/Legacy**: Soft counter to Hardened Scales strategies
- **Cube**: Fair counter-hoser that creates interesting decisions

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Solemnity]] (no counters exist, never triggers), Anti-synergy with +1/+1 counter strategies
- **Potential Combos:** None - now limited to creatures with +1/+1 counters
- **Balance Assessment:** FIXED - Now limited to creatures with +1/+1 counters and made optional ("you may"). No longer breaks planeswalkers or sagas. Fair 3-mana uncommon with counter manipulation.
