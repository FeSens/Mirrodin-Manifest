# Central Planner

## Card Type Line
Creature — Vedalken Advisor

## Rules Text
> At the beginning of your upkeep, if any permanent has more +1/+1 counters or -1/-1 counters on it than another permanent with +1/+1 counters or -1/-1 counters on it, redistribute. *(Choose two permanents. Remove all +1/+1 counters and -1/-1 counters from them, then each gets half that many counters of those types, rounded down.)*

## Flavor Text
> *"Inequality is inefficiency. Inefficiency is unacceptable."*

## Image Prompt
> Central Planner, Vedalken Advisor from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: En-Vidia Lattice — sterile planning chamber with perfect symmetry. Mood: Institutional horror. Pose: Standing before a balance scale, adjusting counters with precise instruments. Key visual elements: Four blue arms each holding measuring tools, chrome-veined skin, counters being equalized on scale, cold blue lighting. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan, clinical white.

## Design Notes
- Forces [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] when inequality exists
- Anti-[[COMPOUND]], anti-accumulation - key tension in the mechanical triangle
- From [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] example cards
- Planned economy enforcer
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Deep-Sik Collective (DeepSeek / Chinese AI)]] - planned economy ideology
- Pairs with: [[Mak-Ron, the Glass Orator]], [[Austerity Minister]], [[Free Market Zealot]]
- **Restriction added:** Limited to +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters only to prevent breaking planeswalkers (loyalty counters) and sagas (lore counters), which would be too oppressive in cross-format play

## Cross-Format Interactions
| External Card | Interaction |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Planeswalkers** | Forces redistribution of loyalty counters - can protect low-loyalty walkers or weaken high-loyalty ones |
| **Solemnity** | With no counters on permanents, Central Planner never triggers |
| **Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider** | Vorinclex doubles your counters, triggers Central Planner constantly |
| **Doubling Season** | Creates massive counter inequality, triggers redistribution every upkeep |
| **Atraxa, Praetors' Voice** | Proliferate creates inequality → forced redistribution |
| **Hardened Scales / Winding Constrictor** | Asymmetric counter growth triggers redistribution |
| **Sagas** | Redistributes lore counters - can accelerate or delay chapter progression! |
| **Poison Counters** | Does NOT affect poison (counters on players, not permanents) |

**Format Assessment:**
- **Commander**: Powerful political tool - prevents any single threat from accumulating counters
- **Modern/Legacy**: Shuts down Hardened Scales, Heliod combo, Walking Ballista strategies
- **Cube**: Strong counter-hoser that creates interesting decisions

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Solemnity]] (no counters exist, never triggers), Anti-synergy with +1/+1 counter strategies
- **Potential Combos:** Can disrupt opponents' Planeswalkers by forcing loyalty redistribution, Saga manipulation (forces chapter counter equalization)
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN - This card automatically equalizes ALL counter types every upkeep. Devastating against: Planeswalkers (loyalty gets redistributed), Sagas (chapter counters get messed up), +1/+1 counter strategies (completely neutered). The effect is too broad and happens automatically. This is a 3-mana stax piece that shuts down entire archetypes. Consider "target opponent's permanent" or limiting to specific counter types.
