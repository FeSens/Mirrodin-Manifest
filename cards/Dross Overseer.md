## Image Prompt
> Dross Overseer, Zombie Cleric from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Vault of Whispers/Dross Dominion — elevated observation point over Mephidross. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Pose: Standing imperiously, watching lesser undead toil and fall below. Key visual elements: Chrome-reinforced skull, dark robes with iron threading, calculating dead eyes surveying domain. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Near-black robes, dark olive, necrogen eye glow.

## Design Notes
- Black uncommon with death trigger value
- Scry helps with Gamble mechanic
- Rewards sacrifice and attrition strategies
- Pairs with: [[Dross Harvester]], [[Mephidross Scavenger]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Skullclamp]] (turns 1/1 tokens into deaths + scry), [[Viscera Seer]] (double scry on each sacrifice), [[Gravecrawler]] (repeated scry through recursion), [[Reassembling Skeleton]] (recursive death triggers)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Scry 1 on death is incremental value. Solid uncommon for Limited and casual play.
