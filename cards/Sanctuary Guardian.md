Pose: Hovering on chrome-feathered mechanical wings, scanning the horizon for threats. Key visual elements: White armor with copper accents, iron-reinforced bone structure visible at joints, wings catching green-filtered light. Style reference: Kev Walker. Color palette: Bronze, copper, white, forest green below.

## Design Notes
- White common flyer with Citizen synergy
- Simple French vanilla+ design for NWO compliance
- Supports WU flyers archetype
- Pairs with: [[Sanctuary City Warden]], [[Civilian Militia]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Panharmonicon]] (4 life on ETB), Flickering ([[Restoration Angel]] - repeated lifegain), [[Soul Warden]] type effects (additional triggers), [[Resplendent Angel]] (5+ life triggers)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Clean common design. Flying 2/3 for 3 with 2 life is reasonable.
