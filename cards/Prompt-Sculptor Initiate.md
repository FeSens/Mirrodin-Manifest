# Prompt-Sculptor Initiate

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Wizard

## Rules Text
> {T}: Scry 1. If you control an artifact, you may compound instead. *(To compound, choose a permanent with a counter on it. Put another counter of a type already on it.)*

## Flavor Text
> *"I don't cast spells. I describe outcomes."*

## Image Prompt
> Prompt-Sculptor Initiate, Human Wizard from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: En-Vidia Lattice — a training chamber with glowing console terminals. Mood: False promise, eager potential. Pose: Kneeling before a console, hands hovering as blue data streams flow from chrome-threaded fingertips into the machine. Key visual elements: Young face with eyes glowing from reflected data, chrome threads woven through robes, metallic veins on forearms pulsing with information. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan data glow, hopeful highlights.

## Design Notes
- Introduces Prompt-Sculptor creature type from [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]]
- Scry represents AI prediction, [[COMPOUND]] represents iterative improvement
- Entry-level card for the AI theme
- Scry synergizes with [[🎲 GAMBLE]] (stack the deck before gambling)
- Pairs with: [[En-Vidia Processing Core]], [[Sal-Tman, Prophet of the Core-Logic]], [[Hallucination Engine]], [[The House Edge]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Hardened Scales]] (extra +1/+1 counters when compounding), [[The Ozolith]] (stores counters for transfer), [[Winding Constrictor]] (additional counters), [[Vorel of the Hull Clade]] (similar doubling effects)
- **Potential Combos:** [[Devoted Druid]] + -1/-1 counter (add more -1/-1 counters, but that kills it). Persist creatures - Compound adds -1/-1, but that stops persist
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Scry 1 on a 2-drop is reasonable (compare to [[Omenspeaker]] 2 mana 1/3 scry 2 ETB). The compound ability costs 2 more mana and a tap, making it slow. Not broken.
