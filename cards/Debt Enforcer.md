Pose: Looming forward, ledger in one hand, other fist clenched. Key visual elements: Iron-veined face with cold eyes, dark chrome-threaded attire, names glowing on ledger pages. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Near-black, dark olive, faint necrogen glow on ledger.

## Design Notes
- Black 5-drop with discard ETB
- Fills high-CMC creature gap
- Economic theme flavor
- Pairs with: [[Loan Shark]], [[Predatory Lending]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Panharmonicon]] (double discard), [[Conjurer's Closet]] / Blink effects (repeated discard), [[Waste Not]] (benefits from forced discard)
- **Potential Combos:** None
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair with menace - Now comparable to other black 5-drops at common.
