# Caravan Survivor

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Citizen

## Rules Text
> Caravan Survivor enters the battlefield with a journey counter on it.
>
> Caravan Survivor gets +2/+2 as long as it has a journey counter on it.
>
> When Caravan Survivor is dealt damage, remove a journey counter from it.

## Flavor Text
> *"The journey nearly broke me. But I'm still here."*

## Image Prompt
> Caravan Survivor, Human Citizen from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Tangle border — edge of copper forest meeting Foundry wasteland. Mood: Exhaustion. Pose: Standing at border marker, journey counter glowing on chest, looking toward distant sanctuary. Key visual elements: Dust-covered traveling clothes, iron-veined skin weathered by journey, copper-threaded pack on back. Style reference: Rebecca Guay meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Copper, forest green, dusty brown.

## Design Notes
- Journey counter represents surviving the trip
- Stronger while fresh from journey
- Damage removes counter (hardships wear you down)
- [[COMPOUND]] restores journey counter
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - refugees surviving dangerous journey
- Pairs with: [[The Darksteel Wall]], [[Mephidross Refugee]], [[Tunneling Hopeful]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Hardened Scales]] (extra counters when adding), [[The Ozolith]] (saves counters), [[Vigor]] (prevents damage, prevents counter removal)
- **Potential Combos:** [[Vigor]] + Caravan Survivor (never loses counter, gains +1/+1 counters instead)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - A 4/5 for 3 that becomes 2/3 when damaged once is reasonable. Green has better options.
