# The Vibe Shift

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Choose one —
> • Counter target artifact spell unless its controller pays {3}.
> • Return target artifact to its owner's hand.
>
> *"Even the believers are starting to doubt."*

## Flavor Text
> *The Thought-Sync's most fervent advocates went quiet. That silence spoke volumes.*

## Image Prompt
> A crowded Vedalken forum where enthusiasm has visibly drained. Where once holographic charts pointed upward, now they trend down. Prominent artificers who once championed the Lattice now sit with arms crossed, expressions skeptical. A single Myr stands at the center, awaiting a command that no longer comes with conviction. The energy has left the room. Fading hype, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Gary Marcus's "astonishing vibe shift"; Ilya Sutskever expressing doubts about LLMs leading to AGI
- **Lore:** The moment when even true believers in the Thought-Sync start questioning
- Modal counterspell or bounce for artifacts—flexible skepticism
- Cheap at 2 mana because doubt spreads fast
- Blue for skepticism, reconsideration, and changing one's mind
- The flavor references how even AI insiders like Sutskever began expressing limitations
- Pairs with: [[Trough of Disillusionment]], [[Sal-Tman's Promise]]
