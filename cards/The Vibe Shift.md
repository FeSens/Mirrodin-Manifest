# The Vibe Shift

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Choose one —
> • Counter target artifact spell unless its controller pays {3}.
> • Return target artifact to its owner's hand.
>
> *"Even the believers are starting to doubt."*

## Flavor Text
> *The Thought-Sync's most fervent advocates went quiet. That silence spoke volumes.*

## Image Prompt
> The Vibe Shift — Instant. Action depicted: A once-enthusiastic Vedalken forum suddenly turning skeptical and silent. Setting: Seat of the Synod — forum chamber where hype is dying. Focal point: Charts trending down, prominent artificers crossing arms, a single Myr awaiting commands that never come. Mood: Suspicion. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Fading cyan hype, cold steel blue, disappointed chrome.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Gary Marcus's "astonishing vibe shift"; Ilya Sutskever expressing doubts about LLMs leading to AGI
- **Lore:** The moment when even true believers in the Thought-Sync start questioning
- Modal counterspell or bounce for artifacts—flexible skepticism
- Cheap at 2 mana because doubt spreads fast
- Blue for skepticism, reconsideration, and changing one's mind
- The flavor references how even AI insiders like Sutskever began expressing limitations
- Pairs with: [[Trough of Disillusionment]], [[Sal-Tman's Promise]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Affinity decks (punishes opponents), artifact hate strategies
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Modal spell with reasonable modes
