# Desperate Crosser

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Citizen

## Rules Text
> Haste
>
> At the beginning of your end step, if Desperate Crosser didn't attack this turn, sacrifice it.

## Flavor Text
> *"Stop or die. Run or die. What choice is that?"*

## Image Prompt
> Desperate Crosser, Human Citizen from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Great Furnace/Mer-Ikan border — barren metal wasteland between zones. Mood: Exhaustion. Pose: Running desperately, glancing back at sweeping searchlights. Key visual elements: Iron-veined legs pumping, ragged clothes, searchlight beams cutting through darkness behind. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Rebecca Guay. Color palette: Furnace orange searchlights, copper ground, dark shadows.

## Design Notes
- Must attack (can't stop moving)
- Punishes exile (burns the deporter)
- Aggressive red 1-drop
- Represents desperate crossing
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - desperate refugees
- Pairs with: [[The Darksteel Wall]], [[Mephidross Refugee]], [[Tunneling Hopeful]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]] (make copies that must attack, then die anyway), [[Goblin Bombardment]] (sacrifice before exile to avoid downsides), [[Sundial of the Infinite]] (end turn before sacrifice trigger)
- **Potential Combos:** With [[Otherworldly Journey]] / [[Cloudshift]] effects: You can exile and return it to "reset" it, taking 2 damage but keeping the creature
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Aggressive 1-drop with real downsides.
