# Gamble with Fate

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Target creature you control fights target creature you don't control. Then gamble. If you win, put a +1/+1 counter on that creature you control.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Tangle teaches: risk everything, gain everything."*

## Image Prompt
> Gamble with Fate — Instant. Action depicted: Two creatures locked in brutal combat, a massive Tangle beast with copper-scaled hide grappling a chrome-plated predator, spectral dice tumbling between them mid-clash. Setting: Dense copper forest of the Tangle, verdigris-stained undergrowth. Focal point: The moment of impact, both creatures committed. Mood: Grim determination, primal risk. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Rebecca Guay. Color palette: Copper, forest green, olive with hints of gold from the dice.

## Design Notes
- Green common instant - addresses Green common gap (-16)
- Addresses common creature ratio issue (need non-creatures)
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] synergy - fight spell with upside
- Green removal (fight effect) per Priority 2
- Simple, NWO-compliant design
- Pairs with [[Opportunistic Growth]], [[The House Edge]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Deathtouch creatures ([[Nightshade Peddler]] soulbond, [[Bow of Nylea]]) + fight kills any creature; [[Krark's Thumb]] gives 75% chance to get the +1/+1 counter bonus; [[Hardened Scales]] adds extra counter on win
- **Potential Combos:** [[Fynn, the Fangbearer]] deathtouch + poison counter synergy; [[Vigor]] prevents your creature from taking damage during fight
- **Balance Assessment:** Balanced - standard fight spell with upside. 1 mana is efficient but requires creature investment
