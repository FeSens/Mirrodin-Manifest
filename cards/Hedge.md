Instant

## Rules Text

## Flavor Text
> *"When the Lattice burns, those with gold walk away whole."*
> — Glimmervoid Investment Doctrine

## Image Prompt
> Hedge — Instant. Action depicted: A Vedalken financier standing serenely within a bubble of golden light, casually examining a gold ingot while chaos erupts outside — explosions frozen mid-blast, structures collapsing, creatures in panicked flight. Setting: The Glimmervoid during a market crash. Focal point: The calm figure at the eye of the storm. Mood: False promise, sanctuary amid horror. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: Serene golds inside, violent reds and blacks outside.

## Design Notes
- Reference cards: [[Holy Day]] ({W}, combat only), [[Safe Passage]] ({2}{W}, you and creatures)
- This prevents ALL damage symmetrically (broader but helps opponents too)
- Gold token adds set flavor and small value for hedging your investment
- {1}{W} is fair for symmetrical effect + minor upside
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - The Aurum Surge / Glimmervoid gold as safe haven
- "Hedge" = financial term for risk mitigation, perfect for the economic themes
- White's protection + artifact/gold synergy

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Isochron Scepter]] (repeatable fog + Gold generation), [[Sunforger]] (tutor and cast), [[Dawn Charm]] (similar effect, different upside)
- **Potential Combos:** [[Isochron Scepter]] + Hedge - Every turn: prevent all damage, make Gold. Infinite mana over time, soft lock.
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Holy Day with upside. Fog effects at 2 mana are standard. Gold token is minor.
