# Foundry Scrapper

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Artificer

## Rules Text
> Sacrifice an artifact: Foundry Scrapper gets +2/+0 until end of turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"Everything burns. Might as well make it useful."*

## Power/Toughness
> 4/4

## Image Prompt
> A burly artificer feeding scrap metal into a makeshift furnace strapped to their back. Fiery and resourceful, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- Red 5-drop with artifact sacrifice synergy
- Fills high-CMC gap at common
- Synergizes with Gold tokens and Myr
- Pairs with: [[Displaced Worker]], [[Scrap Salvager]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Treasure tokens (sacrifice for pump), [[Mycosynth Wellspring]] (sacrifice for land + pump), [[Ichor Wellspring]] (sacrifice for draw + pump), [[Kuldotha Rebirth]] (artifact sacrifice synergy)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Solid limited common. 5 mana 4/4 with upside is appropriate.
