# Foundry Scrapper

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Artificer

## Image Prompt
> Foundry Scrapper, Human Artificer from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Great Furnace/Mer-Ikan Foundry — scrapyard near furnace. Mood: Grim determination. Pose: Feeding scrap metal into makeshift furnace strapped to back, flames erupting behind. Key visual elements: Burly iron-veined frame, back-mounted furnace glowing, artifact scrap mid-sacrifice. Style reference: Kev Walker. Color palette: Furnace orange, copper scrap, bronze skin, dark red flames.

## Design Notes
- Red 5-drop with artifact sacrifice synergy
- Fills high-CMC gap at common
- Synergizes with Gold tokens and Myr
- Pairs with: [[Displaced Worker]], [[Scrap Salvager]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Treasure tokens (sacrifice for pump), [[Mycosynth Wellspring]] (sacrifice for land + pump), [[Ichor Wellspring]] (sacrifice for draw + pump), [[Kuldotha Rebirth]] (artifact sacrifice synergy)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Solid limited common. 5 mana 4/4 with upside is appropriate.
