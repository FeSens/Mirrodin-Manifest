# Extraction Squad Leader

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Soldier Mer-Ikan

## Rules Text
> When Extraction Squad Leader enters the battlefield, exile target creature an opponent controls with mana value 3 or less. Put two -1/-1 counters on it when it returns.
>
> Other Mer-Ikan creatures you control get +1/+0.

## Flavor Text
> *"Voluntary departure... or assisted extraction. Choose quickly."*

## Image Prompt
> Extraction Squad Leader, Human Soldier Mer-Ikan from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Great Furnace/Mer-Ikan Foundry — processing center entrance. Mood: Institutional horror. Pose: Standing with arm raised directing soldiers who drag captured creature toward facility. Key visual elements: White chrome armor with iron-veined face beneath visor, soldiers in synchronized motion, processing facility looming behind. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Greg Staples. Color palette: White armor, bronze accents, dark red processing center interior.

## Design Notes
- Banisher Priest variant with -1/-1 trauma
- Lords other Mer-Ikans
- Extraction = deportation
- Processing marks remain (-1/-1 counters synergize with [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]])
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - deportation squads
- Pairs with: [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[Reprocessing Agent]], [[Foundry Border Commander]], [[Simulated Labor Myr]], [[Inflation Harbinger]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Flickerwisp]] (blink to exile multiple small creatures), [[Solemnity]] (prevents the -1/-1 counters on return - opponent's creature returns clean), Persist creatures (if targeting your own persist creatures... edge case), [[Hapatra, Vizier of Poisons]] (if you can get -1/-1 counters on your creatures)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Conditional exile with downside (creature returns weakened). Balanced uncommon.
