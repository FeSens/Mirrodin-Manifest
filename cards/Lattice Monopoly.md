# Lattice Monopoly

## Card Type Line
Artifact

## Rules Text
> Whenever an artifact enters the battlefield under an opponent's control, you may pay {1}. If you do, draw a card.
>
> {T}: Add one mana of any color. Spend this mana only to cast artifact spells or activate abilities of artifacts.

## Flavor Text
> *The protocol was free. The foundation that controlled it was not.*

## Image Prompt
> Lattice Monopoly — Artifact. Visual focus: A central chrome hub where dozens of standardized connection cables converge, Myr and constructs all plugged into a single "neutral" interface, while shadowy faction leaders stand around the perimeter pulling invisible strings. Setting: The Seat of the Synod, the heart of the protocol. Mood: Institutional horror, false promise. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan standardized connections, shadow-figures in various faction colors.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Anthropic's MCP becoming industry standard; the Agentic AI Foundation
- **Lore:** The Manifest Connection Protocol—whoever controls the standard controls the connections
- You benefit whenever opponents play artifacts (everyone uses the protocol)
- The mana ability represents the protocol enabling artifact ecosystems
- "Open standard, closed committee" is the critique of corporate open-source
- Pairs with: [[The Orb-Seekers]], [[En-Vidia Processing Core]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Unwinding Clock]] (untap to use the mana ability on each turn), [[Vedalken Orrery]] (flash in artifacts on opponent's turn), [[Mycosynth Lattice]] (everything is an artifact, draw whenever opponent plays anything), [[Urza's Saga]] (opponent's constructs trigger this)
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Mycosynth Lattice]] + this (draw a card for {1} whenever opponent plays ANY permanent). In multiplayer, this becomes a massive draw engine
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN with Mycosynth Lattice - With Lattice, every opponent permanent ETB lets you pay 1 to draw. However, this requires a 6-mana artifact setup first. Individually, the card is Fair but flagging the Lattice interaction.
