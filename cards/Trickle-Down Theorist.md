# Trickle-Down Theorist

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Advisor

## Rules Text
> At the beginning of your end step, compound target permanent you control with the most counters on it. *(To compound, put a counter on it of a type already on it.)*
>
> Whenever a permanent you control with five or more counters on it leaves the battlefield, put a +1/+1 counter on each other creature you control.

## Flavor Text
> *"Concentrate wealth at the top. It will flow down... eventually."*

## Image Prompt
> Trickle-Down Theorist, Human Advisor from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Great Furnace — golden tower overlooking worker districts. Mood: False promise. Pose: Standing atop accumulated wealth, gesturing magnanimously while coin falls. Key visual elements: Ornate robes of gold and bronze, tower of accumulated counters, single coin falling toward distant workers who will never catch it. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Gold, bronze, dark red tower, distant workers in muted tones.

## Design Notes
- Forces [[COMPOUND]] on the richest permanent
- "Trickle down" only happens when the rich one dies
- Satirical take on trickle-down economics
- Counter concentration mechanic - pairs with [[Hype Cycle]] for exponential wealth
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Glimmervoid Rally (Gold Rally)]] - economic ideology
- Pairs with: [[Free Market Zealot]], [[Austerity Minister]], [[Bailout Facilitator]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Doubling Season]], [[Hardened Scales]], [[The Ozolith]]
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** Forces counters onto richest permanent; with sacrifice outlets on a counter-heavy permanent, triggers team-wide +1/+1 counters
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - 4-mana 2/4 with conditional effects
