# Resistance Saboteur

## Card Type Line
Creature — Leonin Rogue

## Rules Text
> Deathtouch
>

>
> *"Their tanks are expensive. My explosives are not."*

## Flavor Text
> *"Behind every advance, our people wait."*

## Image Prompt
> Resistance Saboteur, Leonin Rogue from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Dross Dominion — shadow of a massive Nim war machine. Mood: Grim determination. Pose: Crouched beneath the machine, planting copper explosives with practiced precision. Key visual elements: Tawny fur with chrome-tipped mane, iron claws for tools, venomous green eyes reflecting necrogen glow. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Near-black, dark olive, copper highlights.

## Design Notes
- Deathtouch for deadly combat
- Destroys expensive artifacts (tanks/vehicles)
- Sabotage behind enemy lines
- Golgari guerrilla warfare
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - Zel-Ensk's resistance fighters
- Pairs with: [[Zel-Ensk, the Resilient Spark]], [[Nim Occupation Force]], [[Civilian Militia]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Whispersilk Cloak]] (unblockable deathtouch + artifact destruction), [[Shadowspear]] (trample + lifelink for consistent connects), [[Rogue's Passage]] (guaranteed artifact destruction), [[Ohran Frostfang]] (drawing cards when connecting)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - The MV 4+ restriction makes this situational. A 2/1 deathtouch needs help connecting.
