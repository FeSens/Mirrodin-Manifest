# Synod Peacekeeper

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Soldier

## Rules Text
> Vigilance
>
> When Synod Peacekeeper enters the battlefield, tap target creature an opponent controls.

## Flavor Text
> *"Order will be maintained. By any means."*

## Image Prompt
> A uniformed soldier in chrome armor raising a hand, a protester freezing mid-step.

## Design Notes
- White common creature - addresses White common gap (-5)
- Vigilance plus ETB tap for tempo
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Synod of Cognitive Accord]]
- Pairs with: [[Detention Warden]], [[Foundry Checkpoint Officer]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Thassa, Deep-Dwelling]] blink every end step to repeatedly tap creatures; [[Panharmonicon]] doubles ETB trigger, tapping two creatures; [[Conjurer's Closet]] end step blink for repeated tap effects
- **Potential Combos:** [[Deadeye Navigator]] infinite blinks with enough mana = tap all opponent's creatures; [[Restoration Angel]] instant-speed blink for combat tricks; [[Eldrazi Displacer]] repeatable blink with colorless mana
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Solid tempo creature at common. Blink synergies are strong but require deck building investment
