## Image Prompt
> Synod Peacekeeper, Human Soldier from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Mer-Ikan Foundry street — bronze buildings, tense crowd. Mood: Institutional horror masked as peace. Pose: Uniformed soldier raising one chrome-gauntleted hand as a protester freezes mid-step, other hand resting on weapon. Key visual elements: Chrome armor with Synod insignia, iron-reinforced bone visible at jaw, vigilant stance even while enforcing stillness. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Golds, bronze, chrome armor, dark red accents.

## Design Notes
- White common creature - addresses White common gap (-5)
- Vigilance plus ETB tap for tempo
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Synod of Cognitive Accord]]
- Pairs with: [[Detention Warden]], [[Foundry Checkpoint Officer]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Thassa, Deep-Dwelling]] blink every end step to repeatedly tap creatures; [[Panharmonicon]] doubles ETB trigger, tapping two creatures; [[Conjurer's Closet]] end step blink for repeated tap effects
- **Potential Combos:** [[Deadeye Navigator]] infinite blinks with enough mana = tap all opponent's creatures; [[Restoration Angel]] instant-speed blink for combat tricks; [[Eldrazi Displacer]] repeatable blink with colorless mana
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Solid tempo creature at common. Blink synergies are strong but require deck building investment
