# Myr Fabrication Protocol

## Card Type Line
Artifact

## Rules Text
> Myr creatures you control enter the battlefield with an additional +1/+1 counter on them.
>
> {3}, {T}: Create a 1/1 colorless Myr artifact creature token.

## Flavor Text
> *"Efficiency protocol: Replace. Improve. Repeat."*

## Image Prompt
> Myr Fabrication Protocol — Artifact. Visual focus: A chrome assembly apparatus with multiple fabrication arms constructing Myr units in sequence. Setting: En-Vidia Lattice industrial sector, endless conveyor belts. Mood: Institutional horror, relentless efficiency. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Stephan Martiniere. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan energy lines, cold white lighting.

## Design Notes
- **Myr tribal hub** - buffs and replaces Myr
- Connects: [[Myr Replicant]], [[Simulated Labor Myr]], [[Myr-Sourced Automation]], [[The Great Optimization]]
- Replication counter synergy with [[Hype Cycle]]
- Counter synergy (+1/+1 counters on Myr)
- Pairs with [[Recursive Self-Improvement]], [[En-Vidia Processing Core]]
- Automation theme: the machines build more machines
- Death trigger represents efficiency - nothing is wasted

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Myr Galvanizer]] untaps all Myr, infinite combo potential; [[Myr Battlesphere]] creates 4 Myr tokens all entering with counters; [[Hardened Scales]] extra +1/+1 counters on Myr
- **Combos:** [[Myr Galvanizer]] x2 + any mana Myr = infinite mana (all Myr now enter bigger)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fixed - Added "nontoken" to death trigger to prevent infinite loops with Ashnod's Altar. Removed replication counter from activated ability as it served no purpose without other cards referencing it.
