# Dream of the Furnace

## Card Type Line
Creature — Spirit

## Rules Text
> Defender
>
> At the beginning of your upkeep, put a dream counter on Dream of the Furnace.
>
> {T}, Remove three dream counters from Dream of the Furnace: Create a 2/2 white Human Citizen creature token with "This creature can't be exiled."

## Flavor Text
> *"They crossed the sea for a promise. The promise is slow to keep."*

## Image Prompt
> A ghostly vision of the Great Furnace as a beacon of hope, shimmering above the Quicksilver Sea. Distant figures reach toward it.

## Design Notes
- Dream counters accumulate (hope builds)
- Creates protected Citizens (dream realized)
- Defender (doesn't fight, just hopes)
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] accelerates dream counter accumulation, [[COMPOUND]] adds hope
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - immigrant aspirations
- Pairs with: [[DREAM Act Advocate]], [[Asylum Seeker]], [[Sanctuary City Warden]]
