# Dream of the Furnace

## Card Type Line
Creature — Spirit

## Rules Text
> Defender
>
> At the beginning of your upkeep, put a dream counter on Dream of the Furnace.
>
> {T}, Remove three dream counters from Dream of the Furnace: Create a 2/2 white Human Citizen creature token with "This creature can't be exiled."

## Flavor Text
> *"They crossed the sea for a promise. The promise is slow to keep."*

## Image Prompt
> Dream of the Furnace, Spirit from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Quicksilver Sea — distant view of the Great Furnace as shimmering beacon. Mood: Genuine hope. Pose: Ethereal form hovering above mercury waters, facing the distant promise. Key visual elements: Translucent spirit body with chrome bones visible within, Great Furnace glowing golden on horizon, tiny figures reaching toward it from below. Style reference: Rebecca Guay meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: White ghostly form, gold beacon, silver-blue sea.

## Design Notes
- Dream counters accumulate (hope builds)
- Creates protected Citizens (dream realized)
- Defender (doesn't fight, just hopes)
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] accelerates dream counter accumulation, [[COMPOUND]] adds hope
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - immigrant aspirations
- Pairs with: [[DREAM Act Advocate]], [[Asylum Seeker]], [[Sanctuary City Warden]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Proliferate (accelerate token creation), [[Intruder Alarm]] (if you have other creatures to untap it), [[Doubling Season]] (double counters AND double tokens)
- **Potential Combos:** With [[Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider]] + Proliferate: Very fast Citizen generation. With [[Doubling Season]]: 2 counters per upkeep, 2 tokens per activation = 4/4 worth of stats every 2 turns.
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Slow, telegraphed, requires 4 turns minimum for first token without support.
