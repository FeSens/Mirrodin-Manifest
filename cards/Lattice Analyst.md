## Card Type Line
Creature — Vedalken Advisor

## Rules Text

>
> When Lattice Analyst enters the battlefield, draw a card.

## Flavor Text
> *"The patterns are clear to those trained to see them."*

## Image Prompt
> Lattice Analyst, Vedalken Advisor from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Seat of the Synod — suspended above a sprawling holographic data display of the En-Vidia Lattice. Mood: Suspicion, calculated observation. Pose: Hovering with arms crossed, head tilted in analysis, data streams reflecting in enlarged eyes. Key visual elements: Chrome skin with visible data-filament veins, flowing robes that merge with the holographic display, patterns of the Lattice scrolling across their form. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan data-light.

## Design Notes
- Blue common creature - addresses Blue common gap (-11)
- Simple flyer with cantrip for NWO compliance
- Standard Blue common creature
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Ephemerate]] / [[Ghostly Flicker]] (repeated cantrips), [[Panharmonicon]] (double draw triggers), Ninjutsu enablers like [[Yuriko, the Tiger's Shadow]] (evasive body that already drew a card), [[Restoration Angel]] (standard blink value)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - This is essentially a blue common Elvish Visionary variant with flying. Standard limited fare.
