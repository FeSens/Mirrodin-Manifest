# Central Bank Governor

## Card Type Line
Legendary Creature — Human Advisor

## Rules Text

>
> Whenever a permanent is redistributed, you may have target player create a Debt token.

## Flavor Text
> *"Stability requires... adjustments."*

## Image Prompt
> Central Bank Governor, Human Advisor from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Mer-Ikan Foundry — Central Bank throne room, contract-and-ledger throne. Mood: False promise. Pose: Seated regally, one hand waving to redistribute holographic debt markers. Key visual elements: Imposing white and gold robes, chrome crown, Debt tokens orbiting like supplicants, bank spires visible through window. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: Golds, bronze, white, dark red accents.

## Design Notes
- White mythic legendary creature
- Ultimate debt/redistribute lord
- Automatic redistribution every upkeep
- Creates Debt whenever you redistribute (including the automatic one!)
- [[Lore]] connection: central banking critique
- Pairs with: [[The Grand Equalizer]], [[Socialized Losses]], [[The Bailout]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Debt creation cards from this set, [[Doubling Season]] (double Debt tokens created?)
- **Potential Combos:** In multiplayer, every upkeep creates more Debt tokens for opponents, accumulating damage over time
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Powerful in the set's Debt economy but requires significant infrastructure. 5 mana mythic with build-around is fine.
