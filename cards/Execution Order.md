# Execution Order

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Destroy target creature with power 2 or less.

## Flavor Text
> *"Dissent will not be tolerated."*

## Image Prompt
> Execution Order — Instant. Action depicted: A shadowy figure pointing at a condemned target, tendrils of dark energy reaching from extended finger. Setting: Vault of Whispers/Dross Dominion — shadow-drenched execution chamber. Focal point: The pointing hand, dark energy tendrils reaching toward victim. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Style reference: Nils Hamm. Color palette: Near-black shadows, dark olive energy, faint necrogen glow.

## Design Notes
- Black conditional removal at common
- Power restriction keeps it fair for Pauper
- Simple design for NWO compliance
- Pairs with: [[Put-In, the Iron Despot]], [[Silenced Accuser]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Vendetta]] (similar conditional removal), [[Fatal Push]] (comparable cheap removal), [[Tragic Slip]] (works with -power effects), [[Meekstone]] (synergizes with small creature meta)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Appropriately costed conditional removal. Good common.
