## Design Notes
- Red common sorcery - addresses Red common gap (-9)
- Efficient creature removal at sorcery speed
- 3 mana for 4 damage is good rate at sorcery
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Torbran, Thane of Red Fell]] (becomes 6 damage), [[Fiery Emancipation]] (triples to 12), [[Radiant Flames]] (compare: similar rate), [[Bonfire of the Damned]] (similar creature removal)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - 3 mana sorcery for 4 damage to creature is standard rate. Good common.
