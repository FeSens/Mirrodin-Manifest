# En-Vidia Processing Core

## Card Type Line
Artifact

## Rules Text
> En-Vidia Processing Core enters the battlefield with three charge counters on it.
>
> {T}, Remove a charge counter from En-Vidia Processing Core: Add {C}{C}. Spend this mana only to cast artifact spells or activate abilities of artifacts.
>
> {2}, {T}: Scry 2.

## Flavor Text
> *"Every mana crystal they mine is another thought we process."*
> — Overseer of the Lattice

## Image Prompt
> En-Vidia Processing Core — Artifact. Visual focus: A massive crystalline processor core suspended in chrome filament web, pulsing with blue-white energy. Setting: Seat of the Synod/En-Vidia Lattice — heart of data processing infrastructure. Mood: False promise. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome silver, pulsing cyan energy, white core.

## Design Notes
- Mana acceleration for artifact strategies with charge counter fuel
- **Counter synergy:** [[Hype Cycle]] doubles charges (3→6→12), [[Compound]] adds more
- Scry represents "calculated futures", draw requires maintaining charge
- [[Market Crash]] depletes all charges instantly
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - The En-Vidia Lattice processing units (NVIDIA GPUs)
- Scry 2 synergizes with [[🎲 GAMBLE]] (stack the deck before gambling)
- Enables the artifact-heavy themes of the set

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Coretapper]] (adds charge counters to extend mana production), [[Power Conduit]] (counter manipulation), [[Voltaic Key]] (untap for repeated activations), Proliferate effects like [[Inexorable Tide]] (maintain counters while using them)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Limited charges prevent abuse. Requires build-around. Strong in artifact decks but not broken.
