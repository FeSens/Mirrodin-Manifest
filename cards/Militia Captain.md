## Image Prompt
> A battle-worn captain rallying citizen soldiers, their improvised banners held high. Unity in the face of oppression.

## Design Notes
- **Militia/Soldier tribal hub** - connects combat cards
- Connects: [[Rally the Militia]], [[Civilian Militia]], [[War Refugee Camp]], [[Citizen Uprising]], [[Watchtower Defender]]
- Spell trigger creates Citizens for go-wide
- Soldier + Citizen lord (dual tribal)
- Lore connection: [[Lore#Zel-Ensk, the Resilient Spark]]
- Pairs with: [[Zel-Ensk, the Resilient Spark]], [[Hidden Community Elder]], [[Sanctuary City Warden]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Powerful with [[Young Pyromancer]] effects; Works with [[Mentor of the Meek]] (Citizens are 1/1), [[Cathars' Crusade]], and [[Divine Visitation]]; Storm spells like [[Grapeshot]] create multiple tokens
- **Potential Combos:** [[Jeskai Ascendancy]] + cheap cantrips + mana dorks = pseudo-storm with growing army; [[Monastery Mentor]] + this creates double token production; [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]] turns each spell into 2 damage
- **Balance Assessment:** Strong but fair for uncommon. The token creation isn't free mana positive, which limits combo potential
