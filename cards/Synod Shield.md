## Design Notes
- Colorless common equipment - addresses Colorless common gap (-6)
- Defensive equipment with vigilance
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Synod of Cognitive Accord]]
- Pairs with: [[Synod Peacekeeper]], [[Border Wall Sentry]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Puresteel Paladin]] (free equip with metalcraft), [[Stoneforge Mystic]] (tutor and cheat in), [[Kemba, Kha Regent]] (Cat tokens), [[Ardenn, Intrepid Archaeologist]] (free equips)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - +0/+2 and vigilance for 2 to cast and 2 to equip is standard common equipment pricing.
