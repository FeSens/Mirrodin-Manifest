# Mephidross Refugee

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Citizen

## Rules Text
> Mephidross Refugee can't block.
>
> When Mephidross Refugee is put into exile from the battlefield, you may pay 2 life. If you do, return it to your hand.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Dross is poison. The Wall is death. I choose the poison I know."*

## Image Prompt
> Mephidross Refugee, Human Citizen from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The border between Mephidross and the Darksteel Wall — trapped between two nightmares. Mood: Exhaustion, desperate choice. Pose: A haggard figure with iron-veined skin stumbling forward, looking back at the toxic swamps while the gleaming Wall looms ahead, blocking escape. Key visual elements: Ragged clothes stained with necrogen, hollow eyes weighing impossible options, chrome bones visible through malnourished skin. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Near-black swamp behind, cold chrome Wall ahead, human warmth caught between.

## Design Notes
- 1-drop that can evade deportation (exile)
- Can't block (not there to fight)
- Returns to hand when exiled (tries again)
- Mephidross = origin they're fleeing
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - refugees fleeing the Mephidross
- Pairs with: [[The Darksteel Wall]], [[Desperate Crosser]], [[Tunneling Hopeful]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Skullclamp]] (draw 2 repeatedly), [[Grave Pact]] / [[Dictate of Erebos]] (sacrifice synergy), [[Phyrexian Altar]] (sacrifice for mana, recovers from exile), [[Rest in Peace]] (still triggers when exiled even if going to exile zone)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - 1/1 can't block for 1 with exile resilience is unique but not broken.
