# Glimmer-Barge

## Card Type Line
Artifact — Vehicle

## Rules Text
> Whenever Glimmer-Barge attacks, you may exile target creature with mana value 2 or less until Glimmer-Barge leaves the battlefield. When you do, put a cargo counter on Glimmer-Barge.
>
> Glimmer-Barge can't be blocked.
>
> When Glimmer-Barge leaves the battlefield, you may draw cards equal to the number of cargo counters on it.
>
> Crew 1 *(Tap any number of creatures you control with total power 1 or more: This Vehicle becomes an artifact creature until end of turn.)*

## Flavor Text
> *No manifests. No witnesses. No returns.*

## Image Prompt
> A sleek, unmarked vessel with mirrored chrome hull gliding silently across the Quicksilver Sea at night. The liquid metal sea reflects no light. Small, dim figures huddle in the cargo hold, barely visible through slitted windows. The Private Isle looms in the distant fog. Dark silvers, blacks, and muted quicksilver reflections. MTG card art style, sinister and stealthy, noir atmosphere.

## Design Notes
- Vehicle represents the transport used for trafficking
- **Counter synergy:** Cargo counters track victims transported
- [[Hype Cycle]] doubles cargo counters → massive draw when destroyed
- [[Compound]] adds cargo without needing to attack
- Can't be blocked = operates in secrecy
- Low crew cost = few people needed to operate
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - The vessels that carried the Unforged to Ep-Styn's Isle
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - The vessels that carried the Unforged to Ep-Styn's Isle
