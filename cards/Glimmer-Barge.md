## Image Prompt
> Glimmer-Barge — Artifact Vehicle. Visual focus: A sleek unmarked vessel with mirrored chrome hull, cargo hatches sealed, dim figures barely visible through slitted windows. Setting: The Quicksilver Sea at night, Ep-Styn's Private Isle looming in distant fog. Mood: Institutional horror, suspicion. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Dark silvers, near-black, muted quicksilver reflections.

## Design Notes
- Vehicle represents the transport used for trafficking
- **Counter synergy:** Cargo counters track victims transported
- [[Hype Cycle]] doubles cargo counters → massive draw when destroyed
- [[Compound]] adds cargo without needing to attack
- Can't be blocked = operates in secrecy
- Low crew cost = few people needed to operate
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - The vessels that carried the Unforged to Ep-Styn's Isle
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - The vessels that carried the Unforged to Ep-Styn's Isle

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider]] (doubles cargo counters), [[Doubling Season]] (doubles cargo counters), Flicker effects like [[Yorion, Sky Nomad]] (cash out early, get the draw, repeat)
- **Potential Combos:** Repeated flicker = repeated mass draw. Glimmer-Barge + flicker loops with LTB draw could be abused.
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Strong value vehicle but requires setup and attacking. Compare to [[Smuggler's Copter]].
