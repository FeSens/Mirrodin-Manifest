# Jubilee Declaration

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Destroy all Debt tokens. Each player gains 2 life for each Debt token they controlled that was destroyed this way.

## Flavor Text
> *"All debts are forgiven. Begin again."*

## Image Prompt
> Jubilee Declaration — Sorcery. Action depicted: A grand proclamation unfurling from a white tower, golden light radiating outward as Debt tokens across the land dissolve into motes of light, Citizens raising their arms in celebration as their burdens lift. Setting: The Mer-Ikan Foundry, a central plaza beneath the declaration tower. Focal point: The moment of release, debts becoming light. Mood: Genuine hope, universal relief. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Rebecca Guay. Color palette: Golds, bronze, brilliant whites, warm celebratory light.

## Design Notes
- White uncommon sorcery
- Mass debt removal for everyone
- Biblical jubilee reference (debt forgiveness every 50 years)
- Life gain compensates for the reset
- [[Lore]] connection: debt relief programs
- Pairs with: [[Debt Forgiveness]], [[Central Bank Governor]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Debt creation cards (give opponents Debt, then profit from destruction), Lifegain payoffs like [[Heliod's Intervention]] style (mass lifegain)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Set-specific Debt hoser. Symmetrical effect.
