# Debt Ceiling

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> If a Debt token would enter the battlefield, it enters with two additional debt counters on it.

## Flavor Text
> *"The limit? What limit?"*

## Image Prompt
> Debt Ceiling — Enchantment. Visual focus: A literal ceiling of chrome and gold being mechanically raised higher, debt contracts piling beneath. Setting: Synod council chamber, bureaucrats arguing above the rising tide. Mood: False promise. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: White, steel blue, gold accents, dark shadows below.

## Design Notes
- Azorius uncommon enchantment
- Amplifies ALL debt creation (more tokens + bigger debts)
- Debt enters with 3 debt counters instead of 1 = 3x damage when due
- Affects ALL players symmetrically
- Political commentary on debt ceilings being meaningless
- Pairs with: [[Socialized Losses]], [[Central Bank Governor]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Parallel Lives]] / [[Anointed Procession]] (for your opponent via effects like Curse of Disturbance logic - multiplies Debt creation), [[Panharmonicon]] (if ETB Debt creators exist, doubles those), Any Debt creator (Loan Shark now creates 2 Debts with 3 counters each = 6 damage per combat connection)
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** With Default Cascade + any Debt: When Debt is sacrificed, controller creates 2 Debts with 3 counters each. The replacement effect creating +1 Debt tokens means Debt can never be escaped. Creates an unbreakable lock where opponent loses 6+ life per upkeep forever. With [[Hive Mind]] + Debt-creating spells: All players create amplified Debt.
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN when combined with Default Cascade. Recommend changing "that many plus one" to avoid multiplication with Default Cascade.
