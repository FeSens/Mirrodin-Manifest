# Debt Ceiling

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> [[Debt Token|Debt tokens]] enter the battlefield with two additional debt counters on them.
>
> Whenever a player would create one or more Debt tokens, they create that many plus one instead.

## Flavor Text
> *"The limit? What limit?"*

## Image Prompt
> Politicians arguing over a ceiling that keeps being raised higher and higher, while debt piles up below them uncontrollably. The "ceiling" is just a formality. Political satire, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- Azorius uncommon enchantment
- Amplifies ALL debt creation (more tokens + bigger debts)
- Debt enters with 3 debt counters instead of 1 = 3x damage when due
- Affects ALL players symmetrically
- Political commentary on debt ceilings being meaningless
- Pairs with: [[Socialized Losses]], [[Central Bank Governor]]
