# Dross Executioner

## Card Type Line
Creature — Zombie Assassin

## Rules Text
> When Dross Executioner enters the battlefield, target creature gets -2/-2 until end of turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Dross has its own justice."*

## Image Prompt
> Dross Executioner, Zombie Assassin from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Vault of Whispers/Dross Dominion — toxic mist-shrouded execution grounds. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Pose: Emerging from mist, blackened blade raised and dripping with ichor. Key visual elements: Corroded chrome skeleton, iron-veined rotting flesh, blade weeping corrosive fluid. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Near-black flesh, dark olive mist, necrogen glow on blade.

## Design Notes
- Black common creature - addresses Black common gap (-6)
- ETB removal for black common
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Dross (Mephidross)]]
- Pairs with: [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]], [[Reprocessing Agent]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Panharmonicon]] doubles ETB giving -4/-4 total; [[Thassa, Deep-Dwelling]] repeated -2/-2 every end step; [[Conjurer's Closet]] blink for repeated removal
- **Potential Combos:** [[Yarok, the Desecrated]] triples ETB in Sultai; [[Cloudstone Curio]] bounce and replay for repeated triggers; [[Nim Deathmantle]] sacrifice and return for repeated ETBs
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - ETB -2/-2 is a common effect at this cost. Strong with blink but not broken
