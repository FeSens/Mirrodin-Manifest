# Myr Repo Unit

## Card Type Line
Artifact Creature — Myr

## Rules Text
> When Myr Repo Unit enters the battlefield, target opponent creates a Debt token. *(A Debt token is an artifact that enters with two debt counters and "At the beginning of your upkeep, you lose 1 life, then remove a debt counter from this. When the last debt counter is removed, sacrifice it.")*

## Flavor Text
> *"Default detected. Initiating collection protocol."*

## Image Prompt
> Myr Repo Unit, Myr from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The industrial outskirts — approaching a debtor's workshop at dawn. Mood: Institutional horror, inevitable collection. Pose: Marching forward with clamp-appendages extended, red scanning beam sweeping for assets, more units in formation behind. Key visual elements: Chrome body with corporate insignia, clamp-like hands designed for seizure, red targeting beam, debtor's workshop door in crosshairs. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Steel chrome, debt-collection red beam, cold morning light, workshop warmth about to be extinguished.

## Design Notes
- Colorless uncommon creature
- ETB debt creation works in any deck
- 2/2 body is reasonable for 3 mana with upside
- Artifact creature type for set synergies
- Pairs with: [[Debt Collector Myr]], [[Collection Agent]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Panharmonicon]] (double debt creation), [[Conjurer's Closet]] (end step debt creation), [[Metallic Mimic]] (Myr tribal)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - 3 mana 2/2 with opponent gets a 1-damage delayed trigger is reasonable. Standard ETB value, no infinite loops.
