# Nim Occupation Force

## Card Type Line
Creature — Nim Zombie Soldier

## Rules Text
> Menace
>
> When Nim Occupation Force enters the battlefield, put three occupation counters on target land an opponent controls. That land has "At the beginning of your upkeep, you lose 1 life for each occupation counter on this land."
>
> {B}, Remove an occupation counter from a land: Draw a card.

## Flavor Text
> *"They don't conquer. They rot. Everything they touch rots."*

## Image Prompt
> Nim Occupation Force, Nim Zombie Soldier from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Dross Dominion — a once-beautiful Leonin village now occupied. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Pose: Nim soldiers marching in formation through crumbling streets, their very presence causing metal to rust and plants to wither. Key visual elements: Chrome-boned zombies in corroded black armor, necrogen mist seeping from their forms, occupation banners planted in rotting ground. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Daarken. Color palette: Near-black, dark olive, sickly necrogen glow, rust spreading outward.

## Design Notes
- Occupation counters on enemy lands
- Drains life while occupied
- Remove counters for cards (looting/exploitation)
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles occupation damage, [[COMPOUND]] adds counters
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - Put-In's occupation forces
- Pairs with: [[Put-In, the Iron Despot]], [[Rusted Nim Conscript]], [[The Sanctions War]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Spreading Seas]] / [[Blood Moon]] (lock opponent out of using the land entirely while draining them), Proliferate effects ([[Karn's Bastion]], [[Flux Channeler]]) to add more occupation counters, [[Panharmonicon]] to double the ETB putting 6 counters across two lands
- **Potential Combos:** With [[Paradox Haze]] on opponent: doubles their upkeep triggers, 3 life lost instead of 1.5 per counter. With [[Strionic Resonator]] + mana engine: repeat the ETB to lock multiple lands
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - The card draw requires mana and removes the pain effect. 5 mana is reasonable for this effect. The opponent can pay the life or you have to spend resources to draw.
