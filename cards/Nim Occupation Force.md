# Nim Occupation Force

## Card Type Line
Creature — Nim Zombie Soldier

## Rules Text
> Menace
>
> When Nim Occupation Force enters the battlefield, put three occupation counters on target land an opponent controls. That land has "At the beginning of your upkeep, you lose 1 life for each occupation counter on this land."
>
> {B}, Remove an occupation counter from a land: Draw a card.

## Flavor Text
> *"They don't conquer. They rot. Everything they touch rots."*

## Image Prompt
> Nim soldiers occupying a once-beautiful Leonin village, corruption spreading from their presence. The land itself withers.

## Design Notes
- Occupation counters on enemy lands
- Drains life while occupied
- Remove counters for cards (looting/exploitation)
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles occupation damage, [[COMPOUND]] adds counters
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - Put-In's occupation forces
- Pairs with: [[Put-In, the Iron Despot]], [[Rusted Nim Conscript]], [[The Sanctions War]]
