# Processing Queue

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Draw two cards, then put a card from your hand on top of your library.

## Flavor Text
> *"Your request is in the queue. Current wait time: undefined."*

## Image Prompt
> Processing Queue — Sorcery. Action depicted: An endless line of petitioners with chrome-bones visible under weary skin, waiting before an indifferent Vedalken bureaucrat at a processing terminal. Setting: Seat of the Synod administrative chambers. Focal point: The infinite queue stretching into hazy distance while the desk processes one at a time. Mood: Institutional horror, exhaustion. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan screens, dull gray of endless waiting.

## Design Notes
- Blue common sorcery - addresses Blue common gap (-11)
- Card selection for Blue at common
- Sets up top of library - synergizes with [[🎲 GAMBLE]]
- Simple NWO-compliant design
- Pairs with: [[The House Edge]], [[Glimmervoid High Roller]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Brainstorm]] (similar effect, this is sorcery speed), [[Sensei's Divining Top]] (stacks the top for later use), [[Counterbalance]] (set up the top card to counter spells), Miracles like [[Terminus]], [[Entreat the Angels]] (put miracle back on top)
- **Potential Combos:** With [[Mystic Forge]] + cost reducers (keep putting lands on top, cast others). [[Bolas's Citadel]] (stack expensive cards on top to cast for life)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - This is essentially Brainstorm at sorcery speed (draw 2, put 1 back vs draw 3 put 2 back). Less powerful than Brainstorm but still good card selection. Reasonably costed.
