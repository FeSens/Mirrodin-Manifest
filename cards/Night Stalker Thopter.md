> *The pilot took two rounds to the legs. He completed the mission, then flew back to base.*

## Power/Toughness
> 4/3

## Image Prompt
> A sleek, angular military thopter cutting through the night sky over a burning chrome city. Its hull is scarred with blast marks and one engine trails smoke, but it flies on. Foundry soldiers hang from its open bay, weapons ready. Searchlights sweep below but never catch it. The thopter is matte black against the orange glow of fires below. Mirrodin military aesthetic, resilience under fire, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** The 160th SOAR (Night Stalkers) MH-47G that was hit during the insertion; the pilot was shot in the legs but completed the mission and flew back to the USS Iwo Jima
- **Lore adaptation:** Elite Foundry extraction vehicles known for completing missions despite damage
- "Can't be destroyed by flying creatures" represents the Night Stalkers' legendary reputation for flying through heavy fire
- The attack trigger represents delivering troops into combat
- Crew 2 is reasonable for a military aircraft
- 4/3 stats: solid but not invincible
- The flavor text is based on the actual MH-47G pilot's actions
- Pairs with: [[Foundry Strike Team]], [[Operation Absolute Resolve]]
