## Image Prompt
> Night Stalker Thopter — Artifact Vehicle. Visual focus: A sleek, angular matte-black military thopter with battle scars and one smoking engine, cutting through darkness. Setting: Night sky over a burning chrome city, searchlights sweeping below. Mood: Grim determination, relentless mission. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Stephan Martiniere. Color palette: Matte black, furnace orange glow from below, chrome highlights, military grays.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** The 160th SOAR (Night Stalkers) MH-47G that was hit during the insertion; the pilot was shot in the legs but completed the mission and flew back to the USS Iwo Jima
- **Lore adaptation:** Elite Foundry extraction vehicles known for completing missions despite damage
- "Can't be destroyed by flying creatures" represents the Night Stalkers' legendary reputation for flying through heavy fire
- The attack trigger represents delivering troops into combat
- Crew 2 is reasonable for a military aircraft
- 4/3 stats: solid but not invincible
- The flavor text is based on the actual MH-47G pilot's actions
- Pairs with: [[Foundry Strike Team]], [[Operation Absolute Resolve]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Vehicles matter cards ([[King Macar, the Gold-Cursed]], [[Peacewalker Colossus]]), Flying tribal ([[Favorable Winds]]), Combat damage triggers (enables them on ground creatures), [[Smuggler's Copter]] (general vehicle synergy)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - 4 mana 4/3 flying vehicle with utility is appropriate at uncommon. Combat-focused utility vehicle with no infinite combos.
