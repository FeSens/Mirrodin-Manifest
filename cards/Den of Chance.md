## Image Prompt
> A hidden gambling den beneath the Tangle, lit by flickering gold light. Dice and cards scattered on chrome tables. Fortune flows through the very stones.

## Design Notes
- RG land - addresses mana fixing needs (Priority 4)
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] synergy - land with gambling activation
- Gruul colors (fortune/nature theme)
- Conditional mana based on winning gambles
- Pairs with [[Kha-Sino, Fortune's Dealer]], [[The House Edge]]
- Enables gamble-matters deck at land slot

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Krark's Thumb]] improves odds to 75%; [[Chance Encounter]] adds luck counters toward alternate win; [[Okaun, Eye of Chaos]]/[[Zndrsplt, Eye of Wisdom]] partner commanders reward coin flips
- **Potential Combos:** [[Amulet of Vigor]] lets land tap immediately; [[Deserted Temple]] untaps for additional gamble activations
- **Balance Assessment:** Balanced - requires won gamble for colored mana, significant mana to gamble
