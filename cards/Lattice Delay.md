## Image Prompt
> Lattice Delay — Instant. Action depicted: A spell frozen mid-cast, suspended in a web of blue processing energy as the En-Vidia Lattice's bureaucratic protocols analyze and delay it, the caster's frustration visible. Setting: The Seat of the Synod, a spell caught in transit through Lattice space. Focal point: The suspended spell, trapped in validation loops. Mood: Institutional horror, bureaucratic frustration. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan processing-light, spell's original colors muted.

## Design Notes
- Blue common instant - addresses Blue common gap (-11)
- Soft counterspell with scry for NWO compliance
- Scry synergizes with [[🎲 GAMBLE]]
- Standard Blue common interaction
- Pairs with: [[En-Vidia Processing Core]], [[Lattice Overseer]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Baral, Chief of Compliance]] (cost reduction makes this 2 CMC), [[Mystical Tutor]] (standard spell tutoring)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Strictly a limited common. [[Mana Leak]] with scry 1 but 1 more mana.
