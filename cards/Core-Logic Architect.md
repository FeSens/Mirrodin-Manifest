# Core-Logic Architect

## Card Type Line
Creature — Vedalken Artificer

## Rules Text
> When Core-Logic Architect enters the battlefield, put two calculation counters on target artifact you control.
>
> Artifacts you control with counters on them have "{T}: Draw a card, then discard a card."

## Flavor Text
> *"The Myr don't think. They calculate. The distinction is irrelevant."*

## Image Prompt
> Core-Logic Architect, Vedalken Artificer from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: En-Vidia Lattice — central design chamber, massive holographic schematics surrounding. Mood: False promise. Pose: Standing before Lattice schematic, four arms each manipulating different sections. Key visual elements: Pristine white robes with blue trim, chrome-veined skin, calculation counters appearing on touched artifacts, Myr awaiting orders behind. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan holographics, clinical white.

## Design Notes
- Enables artifact-counter synergies
- Calculation counters are a new counter type for the AI theme
- Looting on artifacts with counters rewards [[COMPOUND]]/[[Hype Cycle]]
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]] - Core-Logic designers
- Pairs with: [[En-Vidia Processing Core]], [[Sal-Tman, Prophet of the Core-Logic]], [[Lattice Overseer]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Unwinding Clock]] (untaps all your artifacts during each opponent's untap step, enabling massive looting each turn cycle), [[The Ozolith]] (stores and transfers calculation counters; any artifact you play gets the looting ability), [[Darksteel Citadel]] / Indestructible artifacts (permanent loot engines that can't be easily removed), [[Karn, the Great Creator]] (turns all opponent artifacts into creatures with 0 power, shutting off their looting while yours remains active)
- **Potential Combos:** With [[Intruder Alarm]] + any artifact creature with counters: Each creature entering untaps your artifact creatures, enabling infinite looting with a token generator. With [[Clock of Omens]] + 2+ artifacts with counters: Tap two to untap one, net card filtering.
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Looting isn't card advantage; requires setup and counter synergies.
