# Vindictive Redistribution

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Redistribute among up to four target permanents. For each counter removed this way, each opponent loses 1 life.

## Flavor Text
> *"If I cannot have it, no one can. And you will suffer for my loss."*

## Image Prompt
> Vindictive Redistribution — Sorcery. Action depicted: A vindictive figure violently redistributing counters from wealthy sources, life draining with each removal. Setting: Vault of Whispers courtyard — public space of forced equalization. Focal point: Counters being torn away, each one causing visible pain, equality achieved through universal suffering. Mood: Buried rage. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Near-black, dark olive, necrogen drain glow, life energy escaping.

## Design Notes
- Black rare sorcery - addresses Black rare gap (-4)
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] synergy - Black's weaponized version
- Targets up to 4 permanents for massive redistribution
- Life loss per counter removed can be devastating
- Pairs with [[Spite Redistributor]], [[Counter Vulture]]
- Black's philosophy: if equality must happen, it must hurt

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Hardened Scales]]/[[Doubling Season]] offset counter losses on your permanents; [[Animation Module]] triggers for each counter placed; [[The Ozolith]] stores counters before redistribution
- **Potential Combos:** Target opponent's Planeswalkers - removing loyalty counters while draining life is devastating; [[Heliod, Sun-Crowned]]/[[Walking Ballista]] with many counters - strip counters, drain massive life; Against Hydra creatures - strip counters and drain for each removed
- **Balance Assessment:** Very powerful against counter-heavy strategies. Watch for high-counter permanents
