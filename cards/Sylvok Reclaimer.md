## Image Prompt
> Sylvok Reclaimer, Human Druid from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Tangle border — where copper forest meets encroaching artifact corruption. Mood: Grim determination. Pose: Tearing apart a corrupted artifact with bare iron-veined hands, green energy flowing through arms. Key visual elements: Copper-traced skin, hair woven with living vines, artifact shattering into reclaimed components, nature magic visibly purifying the metal. Style reference: Rebecca Guay meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Copper, forest green, corrupted chrome being cleansed.

## Design Notes
- Green uncommon artifact/enchantment removal
- Creature-based Naturalize effect
- Solid value in artifact-heavy set
- Pairs with: [[Natural Reclamation]], [[Tangle Reclaimer]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Panharmonicon]] (double removal triggers), [[Flickerwisp]] / [[Restoration Angel]] (repeated artifact/enchantment destruction), [[Eternal Witness]] loops (recursion with removal), [[Temur Sabertooth]] (bounce and recast)
- **Potential Combos:** [[Deadeye Navigator]] + Sylvok Reclaimer + 4 mana (infinite artifact/enchantment destruction with mana - strong but requires mana)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - [[Reclamation Sage]] exists at the same cost with same effect. This is a functional reprint, which is fine.
