## Card Type Line

## Flavor Text
> *"When the Lattice fails, only gold remains."*
> — Glimmervoid Survival Doctrine

## Image Prompt
> Aurum Standard — Enchantment. Visual focus: A grand vault with gold ingots emanating protective shields of light. Setting: Glimmervoid vault interior, chaos visible through windows. Mood: False promise. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets John Avon. Color palette: Warm gold and white inside, cold blue destruction outside.

## Design Notes
- **Gold token hub:** Makes EVERY gold-generating card better
- **Counter synergy:** Extra value counter + [[Hype Cycle]] = massive protection/life
- **Defensive:** White's protection theme + economic theme
- **Lore connection:** [[Lore#The Glimmervoid Rally (Gold Rally)]] - Gold as the safe haven
- **Pairs with:** [[Gold Token]], [[Hedge Fund Manager]], [[Hedge]], [[Vault of the Liquid Sun]], [[Glimmervoid Broker]], [[Free Market Zealot]], [[Quantitative Easer]]
- Creates a "gold matters" archetype anchor
- Connects economy theme to White's lifegain/protection
- Anti-aggro: gold becomes shields

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Doubling Season]] / [[Parallel Lives]] (double Gold tokens AND double value counters), [[Academy Manufactor]] (each Gold becomes Gold + Clue + Food), [[Smothering Tithe]] (mass Gold generation)
- **Potential Combos:** [[Jaheira, Friend of the Forest]] + [[Intruder Alarm]] (tokens untap, tap for mana, create more tokens)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Powerful Gold synergy piece but requires setup. The value counter on Gold tokens is novel but not broken.
