# Aurum Standard

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> Whenever a Gold token enters the battlefield under your control, put a value counter on it.
>
> Gold tokens you control have "{T}: Prevent the next damage equal to the number of value counters on this permanent that would be dealt to you or a permanent you control this turn."
>
> Whenever you sacrifice a Gold token, you gain life equal to the number of value counters that were on it.

## Flavor Text
> *"When the Lattice fails, only gold remains."*
> — Glimmervoid Survival Doctrine

## Image Prompt
> A grand vault within the Glimmervoid, walls lined with perfectly stacked gold ingots glowing with protective light. A merchant stands confidently as chaos rages outside—the En-Vidia Lattice crashing, markets collapsing—while inside the vault, everything is calm and golden. Shields of pure gold light emanate from the ingots, deflecting debris. Warm gold and white tones inside, cold blue destruction outside. MTG card art style, safe haven, wealth as protection.

## Design Notes
- **Gold token hub:** Makes EVERY gold-generating card better
- **Counter synergy:** Extra value counter + [[Hype Cycle]] = massive protection/life
- **Defensive:** White's protection theme + economic theme
- **Lore connection:** [[Lore#The Glimmervoid Rally (Gold Rally)]] - Gold as the safe haven
- **Pairs with:** [[Gold Token]], [[Hedge Fund Manager]], [[Hedge]], [[Vault of the Liquid Sun]], [[Glimmervoid Broker]], [[Free Market Zealot]], [[Quantitative Easer]]
- Creates a "gold matters" archetype anchor
- Connects economy theme to White's lifegain/protection
- Anti-aggro: gold becomes shields
