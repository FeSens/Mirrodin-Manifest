# Gold Rush Frenzy

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> Whenever you create a Gold token, creatures you control get +1/+0 until end of turn.
>
> Whenever you sacrifice a Gold token, you may have target creature gain haste and vigilance until end of turn.
>
> {R}{W}: Create a Gold token. Activate only once each turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"The rush isn't in the gold. It's in the hunt."*

## Image Prompt
> Prospectors and warriors charging across the Glimmervoid, gold dust trailing behind them. Excitement and greed fuel their advance.

## Design Notes
- **Gold token aggro hub** - turns gold into combat bonuses
- Connects: [[Hedge]], [[Gold Token]], [[Vault of the Liquid Sun]], [[Hedge Fund Manager]], [[Aurum Standard]]
- Creates Gold for value counter synergy
- Boros (R/W) aggro meets economy theme
- Pairs with [[Glimmervoid Broker]], [[Free Market Zealot]]
- Counter synergy: Gold's value counters work with [[Hype Cycle]]
- Both creation and sacrifice trigger = always value

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[King Macar, the Gold-Cursed]] creates Gold tokens when untapped; [[Goldspan Dragon]] Treasure/Gold token synergy; [[Revel in Riches]] artifact token win condition
- **Potential Combos:** [[Anointed Procession]] doubles Gold token creation; [[Parallel Lives]] more Gold token doubling; [[Marionette Master]] deals damage when artifacts are sacrificed
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Gold token creation is gated to once per turn. Combat bonuses are conditional. Strong in dedicated artifact decks but appropriately costed
