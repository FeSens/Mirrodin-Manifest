## Image Prompt
> Gold Rush Frenzy — Enchantment. Visual focus: A wave of prospectors and warriors with chrome-laced bodies charging across the Glimmervoid, gold dust streaming behind them, weapons raised and eyes wild with greed. Setting: The Glimmervoid plains, gold deposits erupting from the ground. Mood: Buried rage, reckless abandon. Style reference: Kev Walker. Color palette: Gold, white, furnace orange, copper.

## Design Notes
- **Gold token aggro hub** - turns gold into combat bonuses
- Connects: [[Hedge]], [[Gold Token]], [[Vault of the Liquid Sun]], [[Hedge Fund Manager]], [[Aurum Standard]]
- Creates Gold for value counter synergy
- Boros (R/W) aggro meets economy theme
- Pairs with [[Glimmervoid Broker]], [[Free Market Zealot]]
- Counter synergy: Gold's value counters work with [[Hype Cycle]]
- Both creation and sacrifice trigger = always value

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[King Macar, the Gold-Cursed]] creates Gold tokens when untapped; [[Goldspan Dragon]] Treasure/Gold token synergy; [[Revel in Riches]] artifact token win condition
- **Potential Combos:** [[Anointed Procession]] doubles Gold token creation; [[Parallel Lives]] more Gold token doubling; [[Marionette Master]] deals damage when artifacts are sacrificed
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Gold token creation is gated to once per turn. Combat bonuses are conditional. Strong in dedicated artifact decks but appropriately costed
