## Image Prompt
> Master of Debt, Human Warlock from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Dross Dominion — a vault where suffering becomes wealth. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Pose: Standing amid floating treasure and debt contracts, arms spread to receive the gold flowing toward them from bound victims. Key visual elements: Black robes with gold trim, chrome-bone fingers counting coins, eyes glowing with greed, red debt chains extending from their presence to bind unseen debtors. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: Near-black, dark olive, gold flowing inward, blood-red debt chains.

## Design Notes
- Black mythic legendary creature
- Turns opponent's debt into your treasure
- Active debt creation ability
- Deathtouch provides defense
- Inverse relationship with [[Gold Token]]
- Pairs with: [[Loan Shark]], [[Collection Agent]], [[Vulture Capitalist]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Clock of Omens]] (untap Master repeatedly), [[Unwinding Clock]] (untap on each player's turn), [[Thousand-Year Elixir]] + [[Seedborn Muse]] (activate on every turn), [[Intruder Alarm]] + creature ETB debt creators (potential mana loops)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - 5 mana for the effect, requires other debt creators for maximum value. Self-contained 1 debt per turn is slow.
