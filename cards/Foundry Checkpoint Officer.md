# Foundry Checkpoint Officer

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Soldier Mer-Ikan

## Rules Text
> Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under an opponent's control, if it wasn't cast, exile it until Foundry Checkpoint Officer leaves the battlefield.

## Flavor Text
> *"Papers. Now."*

## Image Prompt
> Foundry Checkpoint Officer, Human Soldier Mer-Ikan from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Great Furnace/Mer-Ikan Foundry — industrial checkpoint gate. Mood: Suspicion. Pose: Standing rigid at gate, hand outstretched demanding documents. Key visual elements: White armor with checkpoint insignia, iron-veined stern face, line of anxious creatures waiting behind barricades. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: White armor, bronze gate, gold, dark shadows in waiting line.

## Design Notes
- Auto-exiles tokens, reanimated, cheated creatures
- Deportation mechanic at common
- Mer-Ikan creature type
- Simple, effective hate card
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - checkpoint enforcement
- Pairs with: [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[The Darksteel Wall]], [[Foundry Border Commander]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Containment Priest]] - similar effect; [[Rest in Peace]] prevents graveyard recursion
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Now mirrors Containment Priest more closely but with exile-until-leaves instead of permanent exile. Shuts down [[Reanimate]], [[Animate Dead]], [[Show and Tell]], [[Sneak Attack]], [[Oath of Druids]] but allows creatures to return if removed.
