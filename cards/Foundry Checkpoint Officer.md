# Foundry Checkpoint Officer

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Soldier Mer-Ikan

## Rules Text
> Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under an opponent's control, if that creature wasn't cast from their hand, exile it until Foundry Checkpoint Officer leaves the battlefield.

## Flavor Text
> *"Papers. Now."*

## Image Prompt
> A stern soldier at a metal checkpoint gate, hand outstretched demanding documents. A line of anxious creatures waits. Industrial border control.

## Design Notes
- Auto-exiles tokens, reanimated, cheated creatures
- Deportation mechanic at common
- Mer-Ikan creature type
- Simple, effective hate card
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - checkpoint enforcement
- Pairs with: [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[The Darksteel Wall]], [[Foundry Border Commander]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Containment Priest]] - similar effect but this ALSO hits tokens; [[Rest in Peace]] prevents graveyard recursion
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** Auto-exiles ALL tokens as they enter (devastating vs token strategies); Shuts down [[Reanimate]], [[Animate Dead]], [[Show and Tell]], [[Sneak Attack]], [[Oath of Druids]]
- **Balance Assessment:** BROKEN - Strictly better than Containment Priest against tokens at the same mana cost. A 2-mana creature that auto-exiles all tokens AND all cheated creatures is far too efficient. Consider adding "nontoken" or making it trigger only once per turn
