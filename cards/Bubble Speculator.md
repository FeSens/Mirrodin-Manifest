# Bubble Speculator

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Advisor

## Rules Text
> When Bubble Speculator enters the battlefield, put a bubble counter on target permanent.
>
> At the beginning of your upkeep, double the number of bubble counters on each permanent.
>
> Whenever bubble counters are removed from a permanent, if it had five or more bubble counters on it, sacrifice that permanent.

## Flavor Text
> *"It's not a bubble if it never pops."*

## Image Prompt
> Bubble Speculator, Human Advisor from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: En-Vidia Lattice — trading floor with holographic displays. Mood: Suspicion. Pose: Leaning forward nervously, hands raised toward floating bubbles. Key visual elements: Chrome-rimmed spectacles reflecting bubble light, metallic hair slicked back with sweat, iridescent bubbles swelling with counter energy. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, iridescent highlights.

## Design Notes
- Bubble counters double each turn (exponential growth)
- [[Market Crash]] pops all bubbles (sacrifice when counters removed)
- Creates tension with counter manipulation
- Financial bubble/crash mechanic
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] accelerates bubble growth dangerously
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Great Doubt (The AI Hype Correction)]] - speculative bubbles
- Pairs with: [[Hedge Fund Manager]], [[Inflation Harbinger]], [[Trough of Disillusionment]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Clockspinning]] add/remove counters selectively; [[The Ozolith]] stores counters; [[Solemnity]] prevents bubble growth
- **Potential Combos:** [[Vampire Hexmage]]/[[Aether Snap]] removes counters from your own bubble permanents for controlled sacrifice timing
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Now restricted to your own permanents. Creates interesting tension with your own counter manipulation.
