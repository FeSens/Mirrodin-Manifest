# Border Patrol Thopter

## Card Type Line
Artifact Creature — Thopter Mer-Ikan

## Rules Text
> Flying
>
> Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under an opponent's control, if it wasn't cast, put a surveillance counter on Border Patrol Thopter.
>
> {T}, Remove three surveillance counters from Border Patrol Thopter: Exile target creature with mana value 3 or less.

## Flavor Text
> *"Visual on unauthorized entry. Moving to intercept."*

## Image Prompt
> Border Patrol Thopter, Thopter from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Mer-Ikan Foundry — border zone airspace at dusk. Mood: Institutional horror. Pose: Hovering in scanning position, infrared beams sweeping below. Key visual elements: Sleek chrome body with surveillance arrays, glowing sensor eyes, highlighted targets marked on ground below, surveillance counters pulsing. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Golds, bronze, infrared red beams, chrome.

## Design Notes
- Surveillance counters track illegal entries
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles surveillance for more exiles, [[COMPOUND]] adds counters
- Flying border drone
- Artifact Mer-Ikan creature type
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - border enforcement drones
- Pairs with: [[The Darksteel Wall]], [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[Foundry Checkpoint Officer]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Hunted Phantasm]] / [[Hunted Horror]] (give opponents creatures = surveillance counters), [[Forbidden Orchard]] (Spirit tokens trigger surveillance), [[Oath of Druids]] (opponents cheat creatures = counters)
- **Potential Combos:** [[Forbidden Orchard]] + untap effects (rapid counter accumulation for repeated exile)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Requires opponents to cheat creatures, which you can enable but it's a lot of setup for CMC 3 or less exile.
