## Design Notes
- Represents the Thought-Sync network from [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]]
- Sync counters fuel milling (data harvesting)
- Payoff when depleted represents completed data transfer
- Counter synergy: [[COMPOUND]]/[[Hype Cycle]] extends its lifespan
- Pairs with: [[En-Vidia Processing Core]], [[Sal-Tman, Prophet of the Core-Logic]], [[Data Harvest Drone]]
