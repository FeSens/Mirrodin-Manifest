# Ledger Thief

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Rogue

## Rules Text
> When Ledger Thief enters the battlefield, look at the top five cards of target opponent's library. You may exile one of them face-down. Put the rest back in any order.
>
> {2}{U}, Sacrifice Ledger Thief: Turn all cards exiled face-down by cards you control face-up. You may cast one of them this turn without paying its mana cost.

## Flavor Text
> *"Copies. I made copies."*

## Image Prompt
> Ledger Thief, Human Rogue from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Seat of the Synod — an archive chamber where Redaction-Myr process sensitive documents. Mood: Suspicion, grim determination. Pose: Crouched in shadows, slipping a glowing document into their cloak, eyes gleaming with stolen knowledge. Key visual elements: Hooded figure with iron-veined face barely visible, a single page of the Black Ledger clutched tight, face-down exiled cards represented as shadow-documents in their possession. Style reference: Nils Hamm. Color palette: Steel blue shadows, chrome archive shelves, document-glow, near-black cloak.

## Design Notes
- Exiles information (steals secrets)
- Sacrifice reveals and casts (releasing the truth)
- Works with [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]] face-down exiles
- The whistleblower who made copies

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Venser, the Sojourner]] (repeated looks at opponent's library), [[Panharmonicon]] (double exile triggers), [[Brago, King Eternal]] (blink loops)
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** Could exile opponent's expensive spells and cast them free ([[Omniscience]], [[Enter the Infinite]], or any expensive spell). However, requires setup (ETB + sacrifice) and opponent must have the card in top 5.
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN - The "cast without paying mana cost" has no restrictions on card types. Recommend adding "with mana value 4 or less" or similar restriction. Likely Fair but worth monitoring in testing.
