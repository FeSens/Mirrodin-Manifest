# Ledger Thief

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Rogue

## Rules Text
> When Ledger Thief enters the battlefield, look at the top five cards of target opponent's library. You may exile one of them face-down. Put the rest back in any order.
>
> {2}{U}, Sacrifice Ledger Thief: Turn all cards exiled face-down by cards you control face-up. You may cast one of them this turn without paying its mana cost.

## Flavor Text
> *"Copies. I made copies."*

## Image Prompt
> A hooded figure slipping documents into their cloak while Redaction-Myr work in the background. Their eyes gleam with hidden knowledge. A single page of the Black Ledger is visible. Theft of truth.

## Design Notes
- Exiles information (steals secrets)
- Sacrifice reveals and casts (releasing the truth)
- Works with [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]] face-down exiles
- The whistleblower who made copies
