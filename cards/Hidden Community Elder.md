# Hidden Community Elder

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Advisor

## Rules Text
> Other Citizen creatures you control get +1/+1 and have hexproof.
>

>
> *"They will have to go through me first."*

## Flavor Text
> *"We protect our own. The Foundry takes nothing."*

## Image Prompt
> Hidden Community Elder, Human Advisor from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Tangle borderlands — a hidden sanctuary within copper-root caves. Mood: Grim determination, genuine hope. Pose: Arms spread protectively wide, body positioned between the viewer and the community behind. Key visual elements: Weathered face with chrome-streaked hair, simple but sturdy clothing, Citizen families sheltering in shadows behind. Style reference: Rebecca Guay meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Copper, forest green, olive, warm hidden firelight.

## Design Notes
- Lords Citizens
- Can substitute for exile (takes the hit)
- Hexproof for community protection
- Selesnya immigrant community leader
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - immigrant community protection
- Pairs with: [[Sanctuary City Warden]], [[DREAM Act Advocate]], [[Undocumented Worker]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Citizen token generators (masses of protected Citizens), Protective effects like [[Heroic Intervention]] (redundant protection), [[Parallel Lives]] (more Citizens to protect)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Niche tribal lord, requires Citizen synergy.
