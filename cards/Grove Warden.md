> Grove Warden, Elf Druid from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Tangle — a sacred grove of ancient copper trees with verdigris-covered trunks. Mood: Grim determination, genuine hope. Pose: Standing firm with staff planted, one hand raised in a warding gesture.

Color palette: Copper, forest green, olive, warm amber light.

## Design Notes
- Green 5-drop with lifegain
- Fills high-CMC gap at common
- Simple ETB for NWO compliance
- Pairs with: [[Tel-Jilad Defender]], [[Natural Reclamation]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Panharmonicon]] (double lifegain), Blink effects (repeatable lifegain), [[The Great Henge]] (triggers on ETB)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Standard green common design.
