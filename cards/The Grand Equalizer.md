# The Grand Equalizer

## Card Type Line
Legendary Artifact Creature — Construct

## Rules Text
> Vigilance
>
> When The Grand Equalizer enters the battlefield, redistribute among all permanents with counters on them. *(Remove all counters from all of them, then distribute that many counters evenly among them, rounded down, of the same types.)*
>
> At the beginning of each end step, if any permanent has three or more counters than another permanent with counters, redistribute among those permanents.

## Flavor Text
> *"No one rises. No one falls. All are equal before the Equalizer."*

## Image Prompt
> A massive chrome construct with scales for arms, standing in perfect balance. All around it, counters flow from the wealthy to the poor, evening out. Cold, absolute fairness.

## Design Notes
- White Mythic - addresses White mythic gap (-3)
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] lord - the ultimate redistribute enabler
- ETB mass redistribution is devastating against counter-heavy boards
- Ongoing effect prevents accumulation
- Hard counter to [[COMPOUND]] and [[Hype Cycle]] strategies
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - enforced equality taken to extreme
- Pairs with: [[Central Planner]], [[Equality Enforcer]], [[Austerity Minister]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Solemnity]] prevents any counters from being placed, locks board state; [[Aura Shards]]/[[Reclamation Sage]] remove opponents' counter-generating permanents; [[Thassa, Deep-Dwelling]]/[[Conjurer's Closet]] flicker to trigger mass redistribution repeatedly
- **Potential Combos:** Devastating against Superfriends decks (strips loyalty counters from all planeswalkers); [[Panharmonicon]] doubles the ETB redistribution; Against Modular/Affinity strategies
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN against counter-heavy strategies. The ongoing effect at end step creates a soft lock. Consider removing the automatic end-step trigger or making it only target opponents' permanents
