# Calculated Risk

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Scry 2, then gamble. *(To gamble, you and target opponent reveal the top card of your libraries. Whoever reveals the card with greater mana value wins. If equal, the active player wins.)*
>
> If you win the gamble, draw two cards. If you lose the gamble, draw a card.

## Flavor Text
> *"I don't gamble. I calculate probabilities and act accordingly."*
> — Vedalken market analyst

## Image Prompt
> Calculated Risk — Instant. Action depicted: A Vedalken mid-coin-flip, holographic probability equations surrounding the spinning coin. Setting: En-Vidia Lattice data chamber, chrome walls reflecting calculations. Focal point: The coin at apex of its arc, numbers predicting its fall. Mood: False promise. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Mark Tedin.

## Design Notes
- **Scry-to-Gamble bridge** - connects scry cards to gamble payoffs
- Connects scry cards: [[Data Collector]], [[Processing Queue]], [[Forced Equalization]], [[Lattice Analyst]] to gamble cards
- Scry 2 first = you know what's coming (synergy with [[The House Edge]])
- Floor: draw 1. Ceiling: draw 2. Amazing rate for 2 mana
- Izzet (U/R) - calculated chaos
- Pairs with [[Fortune's Favor]], [[Den of Chance]], [[All-In Gambler]]
- Common for high as-fan of the scry+gamble synergy
- NWO compliant - simple but synergistic

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Krark's Thumb]] flip two coins, ignore one = 75% win rate on gamble; [[Krark, the Thumbless]] spell copying on coin flips; [[Tavern Scoundrel]] creates Treasures on coin flip wins
- **Potential Combos:** [[Chance Encounter]] accumulates luck counters, wins at 10; [[Zndrsplt, Eye of Wisdom]] draws cards on coin flip wins; [[Yusri, Fortune's Flame]] massive card draw with coin flips
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Floor of "draw 1 for 2 mana" is acceptable, ceiling of "draw 2" is strong but not broken. Scry 2 first helps guarantee the good outcome
