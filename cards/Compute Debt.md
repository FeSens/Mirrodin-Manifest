# Compute Debt

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> Whenever you cast an artifact spell, put a debt counter on Compute Debt.
>
> At the beginning of your upkeep, you may draw cards equal to the number of debt counters on Compute Debt. If you do, Compute Debt deals damage equal to the number of debt counters on it to you, then remove all debt counters from it.
>
> *"Spend now. Profit... eventually."*

## Flavor Text
> *The Lattice demanded infinite growth. The treasury had limits.*

## Image Prompt
> Compute Debt — Enchantment. Visual focus: A massive chrome data center under construction, debt counters accumulating on its framework. Setting: En-Vidia Lattice sprawl, power grid straining overhead. Mood: False promise. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, red debt numbers, lightning white.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Microsoft's $440B market cap loss; $7 trillion projected data center investment; OpenAI's $1.4T in commitments
- **Lore:** The unsustainable infrastructure spending on the En-Vidia Lattice
- Debt counters accumulate as you build your artifact empire
- The upkeep trigger: cash in your debt for cards (value) but take damage (the bill comes due)
- Risk/reward: let debt grow for bigger payoff, but bigger damage too
- Blue/Red for reckless innovation and "move fast and break things"
- [[Hype Cycle]] can double debt counters—accelerating both potential and danger
- Pairs with: [[Sal-Tman, Prophet of the Core-Logic]], [[Infrastructure Collapse]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Platinum Angel]]/[[Platinum Emperion]] ignore life loss; [[Phyrexian Unlife]] can't lose to damage; [[Alhammarret's Archive]] double the draws
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Etherium Sculptor]] + 0-cost artifacts ([[Ornithopter]], [[Memnite]], [[Mox Opal]]) = rapid debt counter buildup; [[Krark-Clan Ironworks]] + [[Scrap Trawler]] chains = massive draws; [[Words of Worship]] replaces draws with life gain to negate damage
- **Balance Assessment:** BROKEN - With artifact cost reducers, can draw 10+ cards easily in artifact storm decks. The self-damage may not matter if you win that turn. Consider capping maximum counters or adding additional costs
