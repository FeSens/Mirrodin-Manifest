# Simulated Labor Myr

## Card Type Line
Artifact Creature — Myr

## Rules Text
> {T}: Add {C}. Put a -1/-1 counter on target non-Myr creature you control. Activate only once each turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"Every task it completes is one fewer for you."*

## Image Prompt
> Simulated Labor Myr, Myr from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Mer-Ikan Foundry forge — anvils and metalworking stations. Mood: Institutional horror. Pose: Working with precise, inhuman efficiency at a forge while a human worker watches helplessly in background. Key visual elements: Sleek chrome body optimized for labor, tools built into appendages, displaced human with iron-veined hands holding idle tools, subtle -1/-1 counter aura around the human. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Chrome, bronze, dark red, muted human tones.

## Design Notes
- 1-drop mana dork with a cost: hurts your organic creatures
- Represents AI job displacement mechanically
- -1/-1 counters synergize with [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] (spread the pain)
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]] - The Myr performing "Simulated Labor"
- Pairs with: [[Myr-Sourced Automation]], [[Displaced Worker]], [[Optimization Lie]]
- **Restriction added:** "Activate only once each turn" prevents infinite mana combos with [[Devoted Druid]] and persist creature loops

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Hapatra, Vizier of Poisons]] creates snakes from -1/-1 counters; [[The Scorpion God]] draws cards; [[Nest of Scarabs]] creates insects; [[Yawgmoth, Thran Physician]] synergizes with counter theme
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Devoted Druid]] infinite mana combo (place -1/-1 to untap); [[Persist creatures]] ([[Kitchen Finks]], [[Murderous Redcap]]) + sac outlet = infinite loops; [[Mikaeus, the Unhallowed]] + persist creature + sac outlet
- **Balance Assessment:** FIXED - Added "Activate only once each turn" to prevent infinite mana with Devoted Druid and infinite persist loops
