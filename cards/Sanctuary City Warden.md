# Sanctuary City Warden

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Cleric

## Rules Text
> If a creature you control would be exiled by a spell or ability an opponent controls, instead put a refuge counter on it. It gains hexproof as long as it has a refuge counter on it.
>
> {G}{W}, {T}: Remove all refuge counters from creatures you control. You gain 2 life for each counter removed this way.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Foundry's reach ends at our gates."*

## Image Prompt
> Sanctuary City Warden, Human Cleric from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Tangle — a hidden sanctuary city gate woven from copper vines and living metal. Mood: Grim determination. Pose: Standing defiant before the gate, arms spread protectively as refugees with chrome bone structures gather behind. Key visual elements: Green and white robes with copper trim, iron-veined skin, refuge counters glowing as protective wards around the entrance. Style reference: Rebecca Guay meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Copper, forest green, protective white light.

## Design Notes
- Anti-exile protection
- Counter synergy: Refuge counters provide hexproof, [[Hype Cycle]] doubles, [[COMPOUND]] adds
- Counter to Mer-Ikan deportation theme
- Selesnya sanctuary city flavor
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - sanctuary cities resisting deportation
- Pairs with: [[Hidden Community Elder]], [[DREAM Act Advocate]], [[Asylum Seeker]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Avacyn, Angel of Hope]] + this = creatures can't be destroyed OR exiled; [[Shalai, Voice of Plenty]] stacks hexproof; [[Privileged Position]] double protection
- **Notable Combos:** Replacement effect protects from [[Path to Exile]], [[Swords to Plowshares]] once, then hexproof protects further. The activated ability lets you reset for counter synergies.
- **Balance Assessment:** FIXED - Now a replacement effect that grants hexproof, providing meaningful but not absolute protection. Activated ability provides counter interaction.
