## Card Type Line
Sorcery

>
> You gain 2 life.

## Flavor Text
> *"Equality is not theft. Equality is justice."*

## Image Prompt
> Redistribute the Wealth — Sorcery. Action depicted: A Synod official with chrome-lined robes forcibly dividing glowing counters between two arguing parties with metallic bone structures. Setting: Seat of the Synod judgment chamber, golden and bronze architecture. Focal point: The official's hands splitting a pile of luminous counters. Mood: Institutional horror, forced equality. Style reference: Greg Staples.

## Design Notes
- White common sorcery - addresses White common gap (-11)
- Addresses common creature ratio issue
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] synergy - core redistribute card at common
- White is primary for Redistribute (forced equality)
- Simple, clean design for NWO
- Pairs with [[Central Planner]], [[Mak-Ron, the Glass Orator]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Soul Warden]]/[[Ajani's Welcome]] life gain triggers; Counter manipulation effects - standard redistribute synergies; Aristocrats themes - life gain matters
- **Potential Combos:** Target opponent's planeswalker + another permanent - strip loyalty counters; [[Heliod, Sun-Crowned]] life gain triggers counter placement; Against Sagas - redistribute lore counters to delay or accelerate chapters
- **Balance Assessment:** Balanced - 2 mana sorcery, life gain is minor, redistribute can be situational
