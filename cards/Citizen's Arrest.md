# Citizen's Arrest

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Exile target creature with power 4 or greater.

## Flavor Text
> *"Due process is a luxury the Foundry cannot afford."*

## Image Prompt
> Foundry officers dragging away a large creature in energy shackles, citizens watching silently.

## Design Notes
- White common sorcery - addresses White common gap (-5)
- Conditional exile removal for common
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Synod of Cognitive Accord]]
- Pairs with: [[Detention Warden]], [[Deportation Court Judge]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Strong against cheat-into-play strategies like [[Sneak Attack]], [[Through the Breach]]; Works with [[Containment Priest]] to permanently exile flickered creatures; [[Humility]] makes this hit everything (all creatures become 1/1)
- **Potential Combos:** Very strong against [[Emrakul, the Aeons Torn]] and similar threats; Hits most Commander staples: [[Craterhoof Behemoth]], [[Blightsteel Colossus]]; Similar to [[Exorcise]] from Duskmourn
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Conditional removal at common is appropriate. The power 4+ restriction balances the exile effect
