# Deportation Court Judge

## Card Type Line
Creature — Vedalken Advisor Mer-Ikan

## Rules Text
> At the beginning of your upkeep, put a case counter on Deportation Court Judge.
>
> {T}, Remove X case counters from Deportation Court Judge: Exile up to X target creatures opponents control with total mana value X or less.
>
> Activated abilities of creatures exiled by Deportation Court Judge can't be activated.

## Flavor Text
> *"Case dismissed. Next."*

## Image Prompt
> A stern Vedalken in judicial robes, rapidly stamping deportation orders. A conveyor belt of cases flows past. Assembly line justice.

## Design Notes
- Case counters build toward mass exile
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles cases for bigger deportations, [[COMPOUND]] accelerates
- Silence exiled creatures' abilities
- Immigration court system critique
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - deportation bureaucracy
- Pairs with: [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[Reprocessing Agent]], [[Foundry Border Commander]]
