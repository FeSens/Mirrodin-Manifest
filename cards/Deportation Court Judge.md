## Image Prompt
> Deportation Court Judge, Vedalken Advisor Mer-Ikan from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Great Furnace/Mer-Ikan Foundry — judicial processing chamber. Mood: Institutional horror. Pose: Seated at elevated bench, stamping rapidly, conveyor belt of case files flowing past. Key visual elements: Chrome-plated judicial robes, iron-veined stern face, red DENIED stamps piling up. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: White judicial robes, gold, bronze, dark red stamps.

## Design Notes
- Case counters build toward mass exile
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles cases for bigger deportations, [[COMPOUND]] accelerates
- Silence exiled creatures' abilities
- Immigration court system critique
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - deportation bureaucracy
- Pairs with: [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[Reprocessing Agent]], [[Foundry Border Commander]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Proliferate ([[Atraxa, Praetors' Voice]], [[Inexorable Tide]]) to rapidly accumulate case counters, [[Doubling Season]] (double case counters), [[Strionic Resonator]] (double the counter-adding trigger)
- **Potential Combos:** With Proliferate engine + time: Exile progressively larger creatures each turn. At 10+ case counters, exile most boards. With [[Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider]]: Case counters doubled = exile faster.
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN in Commander - In a proliferate-heavy deck, this scales to exile entire boards. However, it requires tap + removing counters, and is 5 mana. The "activated abilities can't be activated" clause is very strong against certain commanders. Fair in Standard/Limited, potentially oppressive in Commander with proliferate support. Recommend adding "nontoken" to exile restriction, or cap case counter accumulation.
