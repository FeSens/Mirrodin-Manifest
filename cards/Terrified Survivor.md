## Power/Toughness
> 3/5

## Image Prompt
> Terrified Survivor, Human Soldier from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Great Furnace aftermath — chrome wall of a damaged Foundry facility. Mood: Exhaustion. Pose: Sitting slumped against the wall, weapon abandoned, staring at nothing. Key visual elements: Dented gold-bronze armor, blood dried around ears and nose from sonic trauma, hollow eyes, medics tending to others in background. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Muted golds, dark bronze, clinical chrome.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Venezuelan guard who survived the raid and gave testimony about the sonic weapon
- **Counter synergy:** -1/-1 counters represent trauma; base stats 3/5, but enters as 1/3
- [[Hype Cycle]] doubles -1/-1 counters → trauma worsens, but Chapter III heals!
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] can spread trauma to others, or receive it
- Remove counters = recovery, can be healed by +1/+1 counter effects
- Defender represents trauma—he's done attacking
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - military operation aftermath
- Pairs with: [[Resonance Disruptor]], [[Foundry Strike Team]], [[Operation Absolute Resolve]], [[Simulated Labor Myr]], [[Inflation Harbinger]]
