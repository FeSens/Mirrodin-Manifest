# Control The Narrative

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> As Control The Narrative enters, choose two creature types.
>
> Creatures of the first chosen type have protection from creatures of the second chosen type.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Glimmer-Barge logs told stories the Synod refused to read. When the Unforged finally spoke, the chamber had already adjourned—permanently."*
> — Sealed Testimony, Vault Record ██████

## Image Prompt
> Control The Narrative — Enchantment. Visual focus: A page from the Black Ledger with redaction bars obscuring names, Redaction-Myr applying dark ink. Setting: Seat of the Synod, cold chrome desk, hooded figure reflected in surface. Mood: Institutional horror. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, black ink, cold white.

## Design Notes
- Mechanic: Global protection enchantment - represents systemic, institutional cover-up across the entire plane
- Choose two creature types: the first is protected FROM the second (e.g., "Vedalken have protection from Unforged")
- **Lore connection:** [[Lore#The Great Ep-Styn Mystery]] - Directly references the Redacted Archives and the Synod's complicity
- White/Black represents the corruption of Synod institutions (white order) by Vault self-interest (black secrecy)
- References the Glimmer-Barges that transported the Unforged to Ep-Styn's Private Isle
- The Redaction-Myr in the art are the literal censors who scrubbed the Black Ledger
- Gameplay: Name "Vedalken" and "Unforged" to protect corrupt Synod officials from victim testimony
- Or flip it: Name "Unforged" and "Mer-Ikan" to protect survivors from Reprocessing Agents
- The asymmetry is intentional—whoever controls the narrative decides who is untouchable
- Pairs thematically with: [[The Black Ledger]], [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]], [[Unforged Witness]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Changelings (have all creature types, can be named), [[Conspiracy]] (make all your creatures one type), [[Arcane Adaptation]] (all creatures become chosen type)
- **Potential Combos:** [[Conspiracy]] naming "Eldrazi" + Control The Narrative "Eldrazi" from "Human" (your Eldrazi have protection from all Human creatures), With [[Shields of Velis Vel]] (temporary creature type manipulation)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Interesting design space. Both types must be relevant on the battlefield to matter. 3 mana for conditional protection is balanced.
