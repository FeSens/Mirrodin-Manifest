## Image Prompt
> Liang-Wen, the Efficient Mind, Legendary Human Artificer from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Oxidda Chain — a modest workshop of copper pipes and recycled parts, elegant Myr designs emerging from scraps. Mood: Grim determination, defiant innovation. Pose: Hunched over a workbench, hands building something that rivals chrome perfection from humble materials. Key visual elements: Practical work clothes with iron-veined forearms exposed, a banned En-Vidia Core sitting useless behind him, his own creation humming with equal power in front, focused confident expression. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Furnace orange, copper, steel blue from efficient creations, red workshop lighting.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Liang Wenfeng, founder of DeepSeek, who built competitive AI despite US chip sanctions
- **Lore:** Founder of the Deep-Sik Collective in the Oxidda Chain
- Cost reduction rewards efficient artifact builds
- Card draw triggers when you're doing more with less (lower mana value than opponents)
- Blue/Red for innovation, artifice, and defiance
- The quote references how US sanctions forced Chinese AI companies to innovate
- Pairs with: [[Deep-Sik Efficiency]], [[The Sanctions War]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Etherium Sculptor]]/[[Foundry Inspector]] stack cost reductions; [[Vedalken Archmage]] draw + Liang-Wen draw = 2 cards per artifact; [[Jhoira, Weatherlight Captain]] historic triggers
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Mox Opal]] + [[Mox Amber]] + 0-cost artifacts = free artifacts that draw cards; [[Sensei's Divining Top]] + cost reducers = free Top, draw, put on library, repeat for infinite draws; [[Paradoxical Outcome]] chains
- **Balance Assessment:** FIXED - Added "Once each turn" restriction to prevent infinite draw loops with zero-cost artifacts. Now provides strong value without enabling combo kills.
