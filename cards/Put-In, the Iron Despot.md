# Put-In, the Iron Despot

## Card Type Line
Legendary Creature — Human Warlord

## Rules Text
> Menace
>
> At the beginning of your upkeep, create a 2/2 black Nim Zombie creature token with a rust counter on it.
>
> Nim creatures you control have "When this creature dies, if it had a rust counter on it, return it to the battlefield tapped at the beginning of the next end step."
>
> {2}{B}: Put a rust counter on target creature you don't control. It gets -1/-1 until end of turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"Special Acquisitions continue. They always continue."*

## Image Prompt
> Put-In, the Iron Despot, Human Warlord from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Vault of Whispers — a throne room of rusted iron and corruption. Mood: Corrupted triumph, eternal ambition. Pose: Seated on a throne of corroded metal, gaunt and pale, watching Nim legions march endlessly through the chamber behind him. Key visual elements: Cold calculating eyes, black iron armor with rust spreading like infection, chrome-bone fingers gripping armrests, necrogen mist curling at his feet. Style reference: Seb McKinnon meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Near-black, dark olive, rust iron, necrogen glow, cold authority.

## Design Notes
- Put-In from [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - Putin allegory
- Creates zombie army that won't stay dead
- Counter synergy: Rust counters enable recursion and weaken enemies, [[Hype Cycle]] doubles them
- [[Market Crash]] wipes rust counters, potentially killing the army
- Pairs with: [[Zel-Ensk, the Resilient Spark]], [[Nim Occupation Force]], [[Rusted Nim Conscript]], [[The Sanctions War]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Ashnod's Altar]] (sacrifice Nim for mana, they return), [[Grave Pact]] / [[Dictate of Erebos]] (Nim dying forces opponent sacrifices, then they return), [[Phyrexian Altar]] (colored mana from sacrificing Nim), [[Blood Artist]] / [[Zulaport Cutthroat]] (drain on each death/return cycle)
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** With [[Grave Pact]], opponent must sacrifice a creature every turn while your board never shrinks. [[Mikaeus, the Unhallowed]] + Nim with rust counters creates rules questions on which replacement effect applies
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN - The automatic recursion of tokens each end step creates a soft lock with sacrifice outlets. The -1/-1 ability also acts as repeatable removal. However, at 5 mana mythic, this is expected to be powerful. Monitor in testing - the end step return (not immediate) provides counterplay window.
