# Inflation Harbinger

## Card Type Line
Creature — Spirit

## Rules Text
> Haste
>
> When Inflation Harbinger enters the battlefield, put a -1/-1 counter on each creature with a +1/+1 counter on it.

## Flavor Text
> *"Your savings? Worth less every day."*

## Image Prompt
> Inflation Harbinger, Spirit from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Great Furnace — a marketplace district with vendor stalls and trading posts. Mood: Buried rage, economic devastation. Pose: Swooping through the market, trailing heat-distortion and devaluation. Key visual elements: Flame-wreathed incorporeal form, +1/+1 counter crystals wilting and cracking as it passes, merchants recoiling in despair. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: Furnace orange, copper, sickly gold, ash grey.

## Design Notes
- Punishes +1/+1 counter strategies
- Inflation "devalues" existing gains - counters [[COMPOUND]] strategies
- Red's destructive economics
- Common economic hate card
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Great Doubt (The AI Hype Correction)]] - economic instability
- -1/-1 counters synergize with [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] (spread the debuffs)
- Pairs with: [[Market Crash]], [[Bubble Speculator]], [[Quantitative Easer]], [[Simulated Labor Myr]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Panharmonicon]] (double the counter hate), Blink effects (repeatable counter removal), [[Hapatra, Vizier of Poisons]] (-1/-1 counter payoffs), [[The Scorpion God]] (card draw when countered creatures die)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Hosers are fine. Punishes specific strategies.
