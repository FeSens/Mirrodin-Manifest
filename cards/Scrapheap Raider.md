## Image Prompt
> Scrapheap Raider, Goblin Warrior from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Oxidda scrapheap — jagged metal debris and smoldering forge pits. Mood: Buried rage. Pose: Bursting from a pile of scrap in full charge, sparks flying from crude weapons. Key visual elements: Wild iron-flecked eyes, chrome bone visible through torn skin on forearms, makeshift blade trailing sparks. Style reference: Kev Walker. Color palette: Furnace orange, rust, copper, spark yellow.

## Design Notes
- Red common creature - addresses Red common gap (-6)
- Aggressive 2/1 haste with minor downside
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]]
- Pairs with: [[Furnace Populist]], [[Rusted Nim Conscript]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]] (2 damage ETB offsets 1 self-damage), [[Impact Tremors]] (same as above), [[Cavalcade of Calamity]] (1-power attacks), [[Madcap Experiment]] (Goblin tribal)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Standard aggressive common with drawback.
