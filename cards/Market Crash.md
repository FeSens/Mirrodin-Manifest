# Market Crash

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Remove all counters from all permanents.
>
> Each player loses 1 life for each counter removed from permanents they controlled this way.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Lattice promised infinite growth. It never mentioned the floor."*
> — Last transmission from the Synod Trading Floor

## Image Prompt
> Market Crash — Instant. Action depicted: The Synod trading floor in catastrophic collapse — holographic charts plummeting, Vedalken traders with chrome-threaded skin clutching their heads as mana crystals shatter, gold evaporating into nothing. Setting: Seat of the Synod trading floor, En-Vidia node exploding in background. Focal point: A trader with iron-veined hands reaching toward disintegrating wealth as everything crashes to zero. Mood: Institutional horror, total collapse. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: Steel blue shattering into harsh red, chrome going dark, gold dissolving, panic lighting.

## Design Notes
- Clean, devastating effect at instant speed
- Hits +1/+1, -1/-1, charge, loyalty, lore, poison — everything
- Life loss adds additional punishment proportional to investment
- Synergy: Response to [[Hype Cycle]] Chapter II for maximum carnage
- Anti-synergy: Devastating if opponent casts after your counters doubled
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - The inevitable crash of the En-Vidia Lattice bubble
- Black gets "everyone suffers" symmetrical effects

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Phyrexian Etchings]] (removes age counters, stays in play), [[Thing in the Ice]] (removes ice counters, transforms it)
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Dark Depths]] (20 ice counters) + Market Crash = 20/20 indestructible flying [[Marit Lage]] for 3 mana total. The life loss (20 for you if you control Dark Depths) is survivable and can be mitigated. This is extremely powerful - getting a 20/20 indestructible flyer for 3 mana (plus the land) is format-warping.
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN - The Dark Depths interaction exists at the same efficiency as Thespian's Stage but works differently. Also concerning: wipes out planeswalker loyalty (kills all planeswalkers), removes poison counters from players (helps infect victims). Recommendation: Add "nonland permanents" or increase cost significantly.
