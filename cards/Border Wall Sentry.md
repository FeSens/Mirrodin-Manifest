# Border Wall Sentry

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Soldier

## Rules Text
> Defender

## Flavor Text

## Image Prompt

## Design Notes
- White common creature - addresses White common gap (-5)
- Defensive creature for white
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Border Crisis]]
- Pairs with: [[The Darksteel Wall]], [[Border Patrol Thopter]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Arcades, the Strategist]] draws a card when this enters, can attack with toughness; [[High Alert]] assigns combat damage equal to toughness (4 damage attacker); [[Assault Formation]] allows attacking as though it didn't have defender
- **Potential Combos:** [[Perimeter Captain]] gains 2 life when any defender blocks; [[Overgrown Battlement]]/[[Axebane Guardian]] mana generation in defender decks; [[Vent Sentinel]] tap defenders to deal damage equal to defenders controlled
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Efficient defensive stats at common. Becomes powerful in dedicated defender strategies but appropriately costed
