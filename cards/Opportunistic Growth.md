## Image Prompt
> Opportunistic Growth, Plant from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Glimmervoid — a gambling den where fortune literally blooms. Mood: False promise. Pose: A metallic plant unfurling copper petals upward, roots drinking from spilled gold coins. Key visual elements: Chrome stem with copper leaves, golden flower buds that pulse brighter with each nearby dice roll, metal thorns. Style reference: Rebecca Guay meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Copper, forest green, gold accents, bright Glimmervoid white.

## Design Notes
- Green common creature - addresses Green common gap (-16)
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] synergy - rewards winning gambles
- +1/+1 counters synergize with [[Hype Cycle]] and [[COMPOUND]]
- ETB gamble makes it potentially a 4/4 for 3
- "Whenever you win a gamble" is new text that rewards gamble decks
- Pairs with [[The House Edge]], [[Glimmervoid Broker]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Krark's Thumb]] high chance for ETB counters and ongoing growth; [[Hardened Scales]]/[[Branching Evolution]] extra counters per trigger; [[Panharmonicon]] doubles the ETB gamble
- **Potential Combos:** [[Krark's Thumb]] + repeated gambles - grows consistently; [[Doubling Season]] doubles all +1/+1 counters placed; [[Animation Module]] create servos when counters are placed
- **Balance Assessment:** Balanced - 3 mana common creature, requires winning gambles to grow
