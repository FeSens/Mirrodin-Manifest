# Opportunistic Growth

## Card Type Line
Creature — Plant

## Rules Text
> When Opportunistic Growth enters the battlefield, gamble. If you win the gamble, put two +1/+1 counters on it.
>
> Whenever you win a gamble, put a +1/+1 counter on Opportunistic Growth.

## Flavor Text
> *"It grows wherever fortune blooms."*

## Image Prompt
> A strange metallic plant sprouting golden flowers in a Glimmervoid gambling den. It thrives on luck.

## Design Notes
- Green common creature - addresses Green common gap (-16)
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] synergy - rewards winning gambles
- +1/+1 counters synergize with [[Hype Cycle]] and [[COMPOUND]]
- ETB gamble makes it potentially a 4/4 for 3
- "Whenever you win a gamble" is new text that rewards gamble decks
- Pairs with [[The House Edge]], [[Glimmervoid Broker]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Krark's Thumb]] high chance for ETB counters and ongoing growth; [[Hardened Scales]]/[[Branching Evolution]] extra counters per trigger; [[Panharmonicon]] doubles the ETB gamble
- **Potential Combos:** [[Krark's Thumb]] + repeated gambles - grows consistently; [[Doubling Season]] doubles all +1/+1 counters placed; [[Animation Module]] create servos when counters are placed
- **Balance Assessment:** Balanced - 3 mana common creature, requires winning gambles to grow
