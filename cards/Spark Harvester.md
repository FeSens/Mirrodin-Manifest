# Spark Harvester

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Rogue

## Rules Text
> Deathtouch
>
> When Spark Harvester enters the battlefield, create a 1/1 white Human Unforged creature token with a spark counter on it.
>
> Sacrifice an Unforged: Add {B} for each spark counter on it. Draw a card. You lose 1 life.

## Flavor Text
> *"The academies call it 'recruitment.' The ledgers call it 'acquisition.' I call it business."*

## Image Prompt
> Spark Harvester, Human Rogue from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Vault of Whispers hidden dock — a Glimmer-Barge waiting in shadows. Mood: Corrupted triumph masked as welcome. Pose: Standing in doorway offering a chrome-traced hand to a young Unforged whose face glows with their own spark. Key visual elements: Gaunt well-dressed figure with calculating eyes, restraints hidden in other hand revealed by shadow, deceptive warm lighting on victim contrasting cold purple shadows. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Near-black, deep purple, deceptive gold on victim.

## Design Notes
- Creates Unforged tokens with spark counters, then sacrifices them for value
- **Counter synergy:** [[Hype Cycle]] doubles spark counters → more mana on sacrifice
- [[Compound]] can grow individual Unforged before harvesting
- Deathtouch represents the danger of crossing them
- Life loss represents the moral cost
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - Recruiters for Ep-Styn's Spark Trade
- Mechanically rewards building around Unforged tribal + counter manipulation

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Doubling Season]] (double spark counters = double mana), [[Pitiless Plunderer]] (Treasure on Unforged sacrifice), [[Grave Pact]] / [[Dictate of Erebos]] (force opponent sacrifices), [[Carnival of Souls]] (additional mana from creature tokens)
- **Potential Combos:** Spark Harvester + [[Doubling Season]] + [[Parallel Lives]] (create 2 Unforged with 2 spark counters each, sacrifice for 4 mana + 2 cards - potentially loopable with recursion). Spark Harvester + [[Nim Deathmantle]] + 4 mana (create token, sacrifice for B + card, pay 4 to return Harvester, repeat - card-positive)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Sacrifice outlets with card draw exist at this cost. The mana generation is conditional on spark counters which requires setup.
