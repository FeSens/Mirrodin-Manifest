# Austerity Measure

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Redistribute among target [[Debt Token|Debt token]] and target permanent with counters.

## Flavor Text
> *"Cuts must be made somewhere."*

## Image Prompt
> Austerity Measure — Instant. Action depicted: A stern bureaucrat's blade slicing through a glowing budget document, counters scattering between two piles. Setting: Mer-Ikan Foundry administrative chamber, cold bronze walls. Focal point: The moment of the cut, counters mid-flight. Mood: Institutional horror. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Kev Walker.

## Design Notes
- White common instant
- Cheap redistribute trick at {W}
- Can move counters between Debt and +1/+1 counters on creatures
- Instant speed for surprise plays
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] common access
- Pairs with: [[Debt Restructuring]], [[Central Bank Governor]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Any +1/+1 counter creature (move counters to/from Debt), Sagas (can manipulate chapter counters)
- **Potential Combos:** Depends on Redistribute mechanic definition. If it averages counters, could manipulate Sagas.
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Requires Debt token infrastructure from this set. Narrow application.
