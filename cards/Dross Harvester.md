# Dross Harvester

## Card Type Line
Creature — Zombie Worker

## Rules Text
> When Dross Harvester enters the battlefield, return target creature card with mana value 2 or less from your graveyard to your hand.

## Flavor Text
> *"Death is just a temporary inconvenience."*

## Image Prompt
> Dross Harvester, Zombie Worker from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Vault of Whispers/Dross Dominion — necrogen-soaked harvesting pools. Mood: Exhaustion. Pose: Bent over, methodically pulling corpses from muck with chrome-boned hands. Key visual elements: Rusted chrome skeleton visible through rotting flesh, corpse draped over arms, pools of necrogen reflecting sickly light. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Near-black, dark olive pools, faint necrogen glow.

## Design Notes
- Black common creature - addresses Black common gap (-6)
- Graveyard recursion for value
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Dross (Mephidross)]]
- Pairs with: [[Rusted Nim Conscript]], [[Nim Occupation Force]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Gravecrawler]] can always return this from grave; [[Bloodghast]] another recurrable 2-drop to get back; [[Stitcher's Supplier]] fills grave, can be returned by this
- **Potential Combos:** [[Phyrexian Altar]] sacrifice for mana, return another creature; [[Nim Deathmantle]] combo piece that also returns creatures; [[Mikaeus, the Unhallowed]] undying + this creates loops
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Limited recursion (CMC 2 or less) keeps this balanced. Solid value creature but not broken
