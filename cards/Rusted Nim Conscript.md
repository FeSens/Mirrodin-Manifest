# Rusted Nim Conscript

## Card Type Line
Creature — Nim Zombie Soldier

## Rules Text
> Rusted Nim Conscript enters the battlefield with a rust counter on it. It gets -1/-1 for each rust counter on it.
>
> When Rusted Nim Conscript dies, if it had a rust counter on it, return it to the battlefield tapped.

## Flavor Text
> *"They keep marching. They don't know how to stop."*

## Image Prompt
> Rusted Nim Conscript, Nim Zombie Soldier from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Dross Dominion battlefield — necrogen mists and corroded terrain. Mood: Exhaustion. Pose: Trudging forward mindlessly, one arm barely attached, still marching. Key visual elements: Rusted armor with visible corrosion eating through metal, empty eye sockets with faint necrogen glow, rust counter manifested as spreading orange decay. Style reference: Nils Hamm. Color palette: Near-black, rust orange, dark olive, necrogen green glow.

## Design Notes
- Rust counter weakens but enables recursion
- [[Put-In, the Iron Despot]]'s army flavor
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles rust = weaker but still returns
- Endless conscript waves
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - Put-In's endless Nim armies
- Pairs with: [[Put-In, the Iron Despot]], [[Nim Occupation Force]], [[The Sanctions War]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Solemnity]] (if it prevents the rust counter, enters as 2/2), [[Blood Artist]] / [[Zulaport Cutthroat]] (dies repeatedly, draining opponents), [[Mikaeus, the Unhallowed]] (+1/+1 counters cancel rust, undying loops), [[Yawgmoth, Thran Physician]] (remove rust counter, draw cards)
- **Potential Combos:** [[Mikaeus, the Unhallowed]] (+1/+1 from Mikaeus cancels the -1/-1 from rust, making it a 2/2. When it dies, potential rules confusion but not infinite)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Built-in recursion is limited by being tapped and having the rust counter. Aristocrat strategies will like it but it's not format-warping.
