# Debt Collector Myr

## Card Type Line
Artifact Creature — Myr

## Rules Text
> Whenever an opponent sacrifices a Debt token, put a +1/+1 counter on Debt Collector Myr.

## Flavor Text
> *"Payment received. Processing."*

## Image Prompt
> Debt Collector Myr, Myr from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Great Furnace/Mer-Ikan Foundry — debt processing corridor. Mood: Institutional horror. Pose: Striding forward with mechanical purpose, glowing stamp raised. Key visual elements: Chrome body with red "PAID" stamp arm, +1/+1 counter accumulation visible as growing frame, trail of processed debtors behind. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Chrome silver, red stamp glow, dark bronze.

## Design Notes
- Colorless uncommon creature
- Grows when opponent's debts come due
- Works in any debt-focused deck
- Artifact creature for tribal synergies
- Pairs with: [[Myr Repo Unit]], [[Collection Agent]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Hardened Scales]] (extra counters when growing), [[The Ozolith]] (preserves counters), Debt-focused shell (natural payoff)
- **Potential Combos:** None - purely parasitic to Debt mechanic
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Parasitic but balanced payoff.
