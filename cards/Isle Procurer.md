# Isle Procurer

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Rogue

## Rules Text
> When Isle Procurer enters the battlefield, create a 1/1 white Human Unforged creature token.
>
> Whenever another creature you control dies, Isle Procurer gets +1/+0 until end of turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"Fresh potential, as requested. The client list grows."*

## Image Prompt
> Isle Procurer, Human Rogue from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Dross Dominion — a hidden dock at the edge of the Mephidross, Glimmer-Barge waiting in dark waters. Mood: Institutional horror, corrupted triumph. Pose: Standing with one arm extended toward the barge, directing young figures with dim spark-light filing past. Key visual elements: Fine clothes masking predatory intent, iron-veined face half-shadowed, secrecy counters manifesting as shadow-marks. Style reference: Nils Hamm. Color palette: Near-black, dark olive, necrogen glow, cold silver.

## Design Notes
- Creates Unforged with spark counters for [[Spark Harvester]]
- Grows from Unforged deaths (profiting from trafficking)
- Secrecy counters track complicity
- Ep-Styn network recruiter

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Sacrifice outlets like [[Viscera Seer]] (grow Procurer quickly), Token doublers like [[Anointed Procession]] (more Unforged, more counters), [[Skullclamp]] (draw 2, grow Procurer)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Self-contained synergy piece. Needs work to grow.
