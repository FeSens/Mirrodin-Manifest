# Isle Procurer

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Rogue

## Rules Text
> When Isle Procurer enters the battlefield, create a 1/1 white Human Unforged creature token with a spark counter on it.
>
> Whenever an Unforged you control dies, put a secrecy counter on Isle Procurer.
>
> Isle Procurer gets +1/+0 for each secrecy counter on it.

## Flavor Text
> *"Fresh potential, as requested. The client list grows."*

## Image Prompt
> A shadowy figure in fine clothes standing at a hidden dock, gesturing toward a Glimmer-Barge. Young figures with dim spark-light file past. The procurer's face is half-hidden, their smile cold. Dark waters, darker business.

## Design Notes
- Creates Unforged with spark counters for [[Spark Harvester]]
- Grows from Unforged deaths (profiting from trafficking)
- Secrecy counters track complicity
- Ep-Styn network recruiter
