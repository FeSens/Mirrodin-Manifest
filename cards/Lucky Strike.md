# Lucky Strike

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Lucky Strike deals 3 damage to any target.
>
> Gamble. If you win the gamble, Lucky Strike deals 3 damage to another target.

## Flavor Text
> *"Lightning strikes twice for those blessed by fortune."*

## Image Prompt
> Lucky Strike — Instant. Action depicted: A bolt of golden lightning forking mid-strike, one branch already connecting with a target, the second arcing toward another as spectral dice tumble alongside showing the gamble's outcome. Setting: The Great Furnace, combat on a forge-lit battlefield. Focal point: The forking lightning, the moment of doubled fortune. Mood: Buried rage, chaotic triumph. Style reference: Kev Walker. Color palette: Furnace orange, golden lightning, copper, bright strike-light.

## Design Notes
- Red uncommon instant - addresses Red uncommon gap (-10)
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] synergy - potential 2-for-1 removal
- Red removal spell (addresses Priority 2 removal needs)
- High variance, high reward - core Red/Gamble philosophy
- Pairs with [[The House Edge]] (guaranteed second bolt)
- 3 mana for 3 damage floor is fair, 6 damage ceiling is great

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Krark's Thumb]] gives 75% chance to deal 6 total damage for 3 mana; [[Dictate of the Twin Gods]] 6 damage becomes 12 on a win; [[Fiery Emancipation]] 3 damage becomes 9, potentially 18 total
- **Potential Combos:** [[Fork]]/[[Reverberate]] copy for 6 guaranteed + 6 potential damage; [[Krark, the Thumbless]] cast, flip coin - win the flip = copy, spell also has built-in gamble; [[Chance Encounter]] adds luck counters per won gamble
- **Balance Assessment:** Balanced - 3 mana for 3 damage floor is fair, 6 damage ceiling is strong but not broken
