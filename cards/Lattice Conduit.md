# Lattice Conduit

## Card Type Line
Artifact

## Rules Text
> {T}, Sacrifice Lattice Conduit: Add two mana of different colors.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Lattice connects all. Even those who wish to remain separate."*

## Image Prompt
> Lattice Conduit — Artifact. Visual focus: A crystalline conduit with faceted surfaces pulsing with multicolored mana energy, connecting two distant Lattice nodes in the background. Setting: The En-Vidia Lattice, a junction point between network segments. Mood: Cold efficiency, connection without warmth. Style reference: Mark Tedin. Color palette: Steel blue base, prismatic mana colors flowing through, chrome fixtures.

## Design Notes
- Colorless mana fixing at common
- One-shot effect for color splash
- Fills critical mana fixing gap
- Pairs with: [[Lattice Interface]], [[The Lattice Crashes]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Glissa, the Traitor]] (recursion potential), [[Emry, Lurker of the Loch]] (recast from graveyard), [[Teshar, Ancestor's Apostle]] (historic recursion), [[Scrap Trawler]] + [[Myr Retriever]] chains (adds colored mana to artifact loops)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - One-shot mana fixing. [[Chromatic Star]]/[[Chromatic Sphere]] territory with a different upside.
