## Design Notes
- Green common sorcery - addresses Green common gap (-7)
- Artifact/enchantment removal with lifegain
- Green common staple effect
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Tangle Resistance]]
- Pairs with: [[Resistance Saboteur]], [[Tangle Hunter]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Collector Ouphe]] shuts down artifacts while you destroy them; [[Titania's Song]] turns artifacts into creatures before destroying; [[Stony Silence]] artifact hate package
- **Potential Combos:** [[Liquimetal Coating]] turn any permanent into artifact then destroy; [[Liquimetal Torque]] same effect on a mana rock; [[Mycosynth Lattice]] everything is an artifact, destroy anything
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Standard Naturalize effect with lifegain rider. Efficient but not broken
