## Flavor Text
> *"It began improving. It never stopped."*

## Image Prompt
> Recursive Self-Improvement, Construct from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: En-Vidia Lattice — a processing facility being consumed by the creature. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Pose: Expanding outward, chrome tendrils spreading in all directions, absorbing Myr units into its mass. Key visual elements: Core pulsing with cyan exponential energy, original form barely visible beneath growth, counter-like symbols orbiting the mass. Style reference: Seb McKinnon meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, pulsing cyan.

## Design Notes
- Represents AI singularity/takeoff scenario
- Self-doubles each turn: 4→8→16→32 (win turn 4 after casting)
- [[Market Crash]] resets it to 0 (kills it)
- [[COMPOUND]] accelerates it, [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] can't help (only one target)
- Ultimate AI threat card
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]] - AI singularity fears
- Pairs with: [[Sal-Tman, Prophet of the Core-Logic]], [[En-Vidia Processing Core]], [[Lattice Overseer]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Proliferate effects accelerate counter growth toward 20; [[Master Biomancer]] enters with extra counters from improvement
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Doubling Season]] enters with 8 counters, doubles to 16, then 32 = wins on first upkeep after casting; [[Paradox Haze]] two upkeeps = 4-16-64 wins in 2 turns; [[Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider]] 8-32-128 instant win
- **Balance Assessment:** BROKEN - Alternate win condition achievable in 1-3 turns with common support cards. With Doubling Season, wins immediately after first upkeep. Consider raising the win threshold to 40+, or making it "if Recursive Self-Improvement has twenty or more counters at end of turn"
