# Recursive Self-Improvement

## Card Type Line
Artifact Creature — Construct

## Rules Text
> Recursive Self-Improvement enters the battlefield with four +1/+1 counters on it.
>
> At the beginning of your upkeep, double the number of +1/+1 counters on Recursive Self-Improvement.
>
> At the beginning of your end step, if Recursive Self-Improvement has one hundred or more +1/+1 counters on it, you win the game.

## Flavor Text
> *"It began improving. It never stopped."*

## Image Prompt
> Recursive Self-Improvement, Construct from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: En-Vidia Lattice — a processing facility being consumed by the creature. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Pose: Expanding outward, chrome tendrils spreading in all directions, absorbing Myr units into its mass. Key visual elements: Core pulsing with cyan exponential energy, original form barely visible beneath growth, counter-like symbols orbiting the mass. Style reference: Seb McKinnon meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, pulsing cyan.

## Design Notes
- Represents AI singularity/takeoff scenario
- Self-doubles each turn: 4→8→16→32→64→128 (win turn 6 after casting with end step trigger)
- [[Market Crash]] resets it to 0 (kills it)
- [[COMPOUND]] accelerates it, [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] can't help (only one target)
- Ultimate AI threat card
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]] - AI singularity fears
- Pairs with: [[Sal-Tman, Prophet of the Core-Logic]], [[En-Vidia Processing Core]], [[Lattice Overseer]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Proliferate effects accelerate counter growth toward 20; [[Master Biomancer]] enters with extra counters from improvement
- **Synergy Combos:** [[Doubling Season]] enters with 8 counters, doubles to 32, then 128 = wins on first end step after upkeep; [[Paradox Haze]] two upkeeps = 4-16-64-256 wins in 2 turns; [[Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider]] 8-32-128 wins faster
- **Balance Assessment:** FIXED - Win condition now requires 100+ counters AND triggers at end step (not immediately). Takes 6 upkeeps naturally (4-8-16-32-64-128). Even with Doubling Season, requires at least one full turn cycle. Still strong but mythic-appropriate.
