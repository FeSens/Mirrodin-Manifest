## Image Prompt
> Calculated Striker, Human Wizard from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: En-Vidia Lattice — battlefield intersection where data streams cross furnace fire. Mood: Grim determination. Pose: Mid-spell, one hand tracing probability equations, other channeling fire. Key visual elements: Chrome-threaded robes of blue and red, metallic hair crackling with energy, revealed card floating at library top. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Steel blue, furnace orange, chrome.

## Design Notes
- UR signpost uncommon for spells matter
- Prowess + Gamble synergy
- High variance, high reward
- Pairs with: [[🎲 GAMBLE]], [[Pyromantic Gambit]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Brainstorm]] / [[Sensei's Divining Top]] (stack the top card), [[Monastery Mentor]] (spells-matter shell), Storm cards (each spell triggers the reveal)
- **Potential Combos:** With top manipulation + cantrip chains (reliable 2 damage per spell), [[Paradox Engine]] (banned) / [[Jeskai Ascendancy]] (storm off with prowess + damage triggers)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - The "if instant/sorcery" check adds variance. In a spells-heavy deck (60%+ instants/sorceries), this is strong but not broken. Prowess is the main feature.
