# Market Manipulation

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Compound three times, choosing the same permanent each time.
>
> Then gamble. If you lose the gamble, redistribute, choosing that permanent and target permanent an opponent controls.

## Flavor Text
> *"Inflate. Bet. Crash. Repeat. The only losers are the ones who believed it was real."*
> — Kha-Sino, Glimmervoid Broker

## Image Prompt
> A Vedalken broker in a Glimmervoid trading pit, hands raised dramatically as holographic charts spike upward behind him. Myr traders scramble around chrome terminals. One chart shows a meteoric rise—another shows the same asset plummeting. In the broker's eyes: cold calculation. He knows exactly when to sell. Gold and blue lighting, frantic energy frozen in a moment of orchestrated chaos. MTG card art style, financial horror, the moment before the crash.

## Design Notes
- **Mechanic:** Uses all three set mechanics in sequence — Compound, Gamble, Redistribute
- **The Pump and Dump:** Inflate a permanent with three compound triggers (massive growth), then gamble on it
- If you WIN the gamble: you keep all that compounded value — pure profit
- If you LOSE the gamble: you redistribute, forcing the inflated permanent to share its counters with an opponent's permanent — spreading the crash
- The opponent's permanent gets dragged into your failure (bailout mentality)
- **Lore connection:** [[The House Edge]] — Kha-Sino returns, running schemes in the Glimmervoid
- Blue/Black represents calculated exploitation and information asymmetry
- **Synergy:** Devastating with [[The House Edge]] — scry first to nearly guarantee the win
- Pairs with: [[🎲 GAMBLE]], [[COMPOUND]], [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]], [[Hype Cycle]]
