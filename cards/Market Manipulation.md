# Market Manipulation

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Choose target permanent you control with a counter on it. Compound three times, choosing that permanent each time. *(To compound, put a counter on it of a type already on it.)*
>
> Then gamble with target opponent. If you win, draw a card. If you lose, remove all counters from that permanent.

## Flavor Text
> *"Inflate. Bet. Crash. Repeat. The only losers are the ones who believed it was real."*
> — Kha-Sino, Glimmervoid Broker

## Image Prompt
> Market Manipulation — Sorcery. Action depicted: A Vedalken broker with chrome-threaded face raising hands as holographic charts spike impossibly upward, while a second hidden chart shows the inevitable plummet. Setting: Glimmervoid trading pit, Myr scrambling at chrome terminals. Focal point: The broker's cold, calculating eyes — he knows exactly when to sell. Mood: False promise, orchestrated betrayal. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Gold, steel blue, Glimmervoid white, the sickly green of hidden charts.

## Design Notes
- **Mechanic:** Uses Compound + Gamble (was three mechanics — simplified for playability)
- **The Pump and Dump:** Inflate a permanent with three compound triggers, then gamble
- If you WIN the gamble: you keep all that compounded value + draw a card — pure profit
- If you LOSE the gamble: you lose the three counters you just added — the bubble pops
- **Lore connection:** [[The House Edge]] — Kha-Sino returns, running schemes in the Glimmervoid
- Blue/Black represents calculated exploitation and information asymmetry
- **Synergy:** Devastating with [[The House Edge]] — scry first to nearly guarantee the win
- Pairs with: [[🎲 GAMBLE]], [[COMPOUND]], [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]], [[Hype Cycle]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Doubling Season]] (doubled counters from each compound), [[Hardened Scales]] (+1 on each compound), Planeswalkers (add 3 loyalty to any planeswalker - can instantly ultimate most walkers)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Requires setup, sorcery speed, 4 mana in two colors. The gamble downside is real without manipulation. With scry manipulation, nearly guaranteed 3x compound with no downside.
