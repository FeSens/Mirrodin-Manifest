## Image Prompt
> Gambler's Instinct — Instant. Action depicted: A furnace worker with iron-veined arms hurling molten dice, flames spiraling from their fingertips in chaotic arcs, the dice showing different values mid-tumble. Setting: The Great Furnace forge floor, sparks and heat haze. Focal point: The burning dice suspended in air. Mood: Reckless abandon, buried rage unleashed. Style reference: Kev Walker. Color palette: Furnace orange, copper, molten gold.

## Design Notes
- Red common instant - addresses Red common gap (-16)
- Addresses common creature ratio issue (94.7% creatures currently)
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] synergy - core gamble card at common
- Pairs with [[The House Edge]] (scry before this for guaranteed 3 damage)
- Simple NWO-compliant design for common
- Removal spell for Red (direct damage)

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Sensei's Divining Top]] (set up wins by knowing top card), [[Scroll Rack]] (manipulate top of library), [[Sylvan Library]] (know your top card CMC)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Average 2 damage for R with variance. Lightning Bolt is strictly better.
