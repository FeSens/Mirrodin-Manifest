# Foundry Wall Captain

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Soldier Mer-Ikan

> Whenever a creature is exiled from under an opponent's control, put a deportation counter on Foundry Wall Captain.
>

## Flavor Text
> *"The numbers speak for themselves. Enforcement works."*

## Image Prompt
> Foundry Wall Captain, Human Soldier Mer-Ikan from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Great Furnace/Mer-Ikan Foundry — atop the Darksteel Wall overlooking border. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Pose: Standing proud atop wall, surveying deportation statistics with satisfaction. Key visual elements: Chrome-plated armor with medals gleaming, iron-veined face showing pride, wall stretching infinitely behind, processed figures below. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Kev Walker. Color palette: White armor, gold medals, bronze wall, furnace orange horizon.

## Design Notes
- Deportation counters track exiles
- Lords all Mer-Ikans based on deportations
- Ultimate mass exile of "illegal" creatures
- Boros enforcement commander
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles deportation counters, [[COMPOUND]] accelerates
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - border enforcement leadership
- Pairs with: [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[The Darksteel Wall]], [[Reprocessing Agent]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Oblivion Ring chains (generate counters through repeated exile), Fiend Hunter (exile triggers add counters), Skyclave Apparition (exile creatures for counters), Eldrazi Displacer (repeatedly exile/return for counter buildup)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Build-around rare. Requires exile synergy to maximize. The ultimate ability is powerful but telegraphed.
