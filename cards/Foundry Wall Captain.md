# Foundry Wall Captain

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Soldier Mer-Ikan

## Rules Text
> Whenever a creature is exiled from under an opponent's control, put a deportation counter on Foundry Wall Captain.
>
> Mer-Ikan creatures you control get +1/+1 for each deportation counter on Foundry Wall Captain.
>
> {R}{W}, Remove five deportation counters from Foundry Wall Captain: Exile all creatures opponents control that weren't cast from their hands.

## Flavor Text
> *"The numbers speak for themselves. Enforcement works."*

## Image Prompt
> A decorated commander standing atop the Darksteel Wall, surveying their deportation statistics with satisfaction. Medals gleam. Pride in cruelty.

## Design Notes
- Deportation counters track exiles
- Lords all Mer-Ikans based on deportations
- Ultimate mass exile of "illegal" creatures
- Boros enforcement commander
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles deportation counters, [[COMPOUND]] accelerates
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - border enforcement leadership
- Pairs with: [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[The Darksteel Wall]], [[Reprocessing Agent]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Oblivion Ring chains (generate counters through repeated exile), Fiend Hunter (exile triggers add counters), Skyclave Apparition (exile creatures for counters), Eldrazi Displacer (repeatedly exile/return for counter buildup)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Build-around rare. Requires exile synergy to maximize. The ultimate ability is powerful but telegraphed.
