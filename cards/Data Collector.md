# Data Collector

## Card Type Line
Creature — Vedalken Wizard

## Rules Text
> When Data Collector enters the battlefield, scry 2.

## Flavor Text
> *"Every interaction is logged. Every pattern, analyzed."*

## Image Prompt
> Data Collector, Vedalken Wizard from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Seat of the Synod/En-Vidia Lattice — data processing chamber with flowing information streams. Mood: Institutional horror. Pose: Standing rigid, multiple mechanical eyes scanning in different directions. Key visual elements: Chrome-plated skull with sensor arrays, iron-veined blue skin, holographic data cascading around them. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan glow.

## Design Notes
- Blue common creature - addresses Blue common gap (-11)
- Simple ETB scry for NWO compliance
- Scry synergizes with [[🎲 GAMBLE]]
- Defensive stats for Blue
- Pairs with: [[The House Edge]], [[Data Harvest Drone]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Panharmonicon]] (double scry 2), Flicker effects ([[Ephemerate]], [[Restoration Angel]]) for repeated scry value, [[Thassa's Oracle]] / [[Jace, Wielder of Mysteries]] (scry helps set up winning conditions)
- **Potential Combos:** None
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Vanilla common, completely reasonable.
