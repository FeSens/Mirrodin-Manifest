# Detention Warden

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Soldier Mer-Ikan

## Rules Text
> When Detention Warden enters the battlefield, exile up to two target creatures an opponent controls with mana value 2 or less each until Detention Warden leaves the battlefield.

## Flavor Text
> *"Capacity is not my concern."*

## Image Prompt
> Detention Warden, Human Soldier Mer-Ikan from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Great Furnace/Mer-Ikan Foundry — massive detention facility. Mood: Institutional horror. Pose: Standing with arms crossed before endless rows of chrome cells. Key visual elements: White-armored body with iron-veined face, facility stretching infinitely behind, captured creatures visible in cells. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: White armor, bronze cells, dark shadows within.

## Design Notes
- Mass exile with detention counters
- More detainees = more protection (indestructible)
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles detention counters, [[Market Crash]] releases all
- Detention facility mechanic
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - detention centers
- Pairs with: [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[Reprocessing Agent]], [[Family Separation Agent]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Proliferate (push toward indestructible faster), Flicker effects (reset and exile more creatures, though loses counters), [[Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider]] (double detention counters)
- **Potential Combos:** [[Solemnity]] - BREAKS THE CARD - enters with 0 counters, can't add counters, creatures are PERMANENTLY exiled (can't leave battlefield without counters), but also never gains indestructible. With enough creatures: Exile 3+ creatures = 6 counters = indestructible = permanent exile.
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Banisher Priest variant with upside. Counters can be removed (Market Crash, Vampire Hexmage). Solemnity interaction is interesting but Solemnity is already a build-around card.
