## Image Prompt
> All-In Gambler, Human Rogue from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Great Furnace — smoky gambling den near the forge fires. Mood: Grim determination. Pose: Charging forward mid-battle, arms spread wide in reckless abandon. Key visual elements: Wild eyes reflecting furnace light, chrome-plated knuckles, coins and dice orbiting body. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Furnace orange, copper, gold accents.

## Design Notes
- Red rare creature - addresses Red rare gap (-10, critical!)
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] synergy - ultimate high-stakes card
- Win = 8 power attacker, Lose = sacrifice
- Haste for immediate impact
- Pairs with [[The House Edge]] (guaranteed double power)
- Core design philosophy of Red Gamble archetype

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Krark's Thumb]] gives 75% chance to double power (8 power attacker), only 25% sacrifice; [[Temur Battle Rage]] double strike + doubled power = 16+ damage; [[Unleash Fury]] stack power doublings for massive damage
- **Potential Combos:** [[Krark's Thumb]] + [[Fatal Frenzy]] quadruple power (4 -> 8 -> 16 power) for one-shot kills; [[Chance for Glory]] extra combat, can attack again with doubled power; [[Inquisitor's Flail]] damage doubling equipment stacks with power doubling
- **Balance Assessment:** Balanced by the sacrifice risk. With Krark's Thumb, becomes very reliable but still dies to removal. High-risk, high-reward as intended
