# The Truth Emerges

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Turn all face-down exiled cards face-up.
>
> For each card turned face-up this way, its owner loses 2 life and you draw a card.
>
> You may cast up to one spell from among cards turned face-up this way without paying its mana cost.

## Flavor Text
> *"The redactions failed. The names are readable. Everyone will know."*

## Image Prompt
> Documents flying into the air, their redacted sections burning away to reveal the hidden text beneath. Names glow accusingly. The cover-up collapses.

## Design Notes
- **Face-down exile payoff** - the big reveal
- Connects: [[Ledger Thief]], [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]], [[Control The Narrative]], [[Archive Scrubbing]]
- Punishes opponents who exiled cards face-down
- Rewards you for your own face-down exiles
- Dimir (U/B) - truth as a weapon
- Pairs with [[The Black Ledger]], [[Redaction-Myr]]
- The whistleblower's ultimate weapon
- Free cast represents the evidence being used

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Gonti, Lord of Luxury]] exiles cards face-down; [[Thief of Sanity]] and [[Nightveil Specter]] exile face-down; [[Praetor's Grasp]] tutors and exiles face-down
- **POTENTIALLY BROKEN Combos:** [[Inverter of Truth]] exiles YOUR entire library face-down, this turns them ALL face-up, drawing cards equal to your library size and dealing 2 life per card while getting a free cast - this is a two-card combo that likely wins the game
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN - The interaction with Inverter of Truth is extremely concerning. Consider adding "exile cards an opponent owns" restriction or capping the number of cards that can be turned face-up
