# Archive Corruptor

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Rogue

## Rules Text
> Whenever Archive Corruptor deals combat damage to a player, that player mills three cards. You may put a creature card from among them into your hand.

## Flavor Text
> *"Information is currency. I'm making a withdrawal."*

## Power/Toughness
> 2/2

## Image Prompt
> Archive Corruptor, Human Rogue from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: En-Vidia Lattice — deep within the data archives, chrome storage towers surrounding. Mood: Suspicion. Pose: Crouched at a data terminal, one hand extracting glowing information, other corrupting records. Key visual elements: Dark hood with chrome threading, iron-veined hands manipulating data streams, stolen creature silhouettes visible in extracted light. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan data streams, shadows.

## Design Notes
- UB signpost uncommon for mill/graveyard
- Mill + selective recursion
- Rewards getting through for damage
- Pairs with: [[Archive Scrubbing]], [[Mephidross Collector]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Rogue's Passage]] / [[Whispersilk Cloak]] (guarantees combat damage trigger), [[Sword of Body and Mind]] (more mill synergy), [[Tasha, the Witch Queen]] (mill payoff commander)
- **Potential Combos:** No infinite combos, but strong value engine with evasion enablers
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Requires connecting with combat damage, and only gets creatures from the mill. Standard power level for a UB uncommon.
