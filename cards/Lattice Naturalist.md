# Lattice Naturalist

## Card Type Line

## Flavor Text
> *"Nature and data are both patterns. I read both."*

## Image Prompt
> Lattice Naturalist, Elf Wizard from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Tangle's edge — where copper forest meets Lattice data streams, organic and digital intertwined. Mood: Genuine hope, pattern recognition. Pose: Standing at the intersection, one hand touching a copper vine, the other trailing through holographic data, eyes glowing with dual insight. Key visual elements: Chrome-veined skin with bark patches, +1/+1 counter crystals growing where data and nature meet, scry-light reflecting in forest-green eyes. Style reference: Rebecca Guay meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Copper, forest green, steel blue data-streams, cyan accents.

## Design Notes
- GU signpost uncommon - scry/counters theme
- Self-enabling scry synergy
- Counter synergy with [[COMPOUND]] and [[🎲 GAMBLE]]
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Tangle Resistance]]
- Pairs with: [[Data Collector]], [[Hype Cycle]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Thassa, God of the Sea]] (free scry every upkeep = free +1/+1), [[Crystal Ball]] (repeatable scry with counter synergy), [[Lifecrafter's Bestiary]] (upkeep scry triggers), [[Sensei's Divining Top]] + untappers (repeated counters)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Self-contained scry engine that grows. Slow but solid.
