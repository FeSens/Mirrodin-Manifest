# Sylvok Rejection

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Target creature gets +3/+3 until end of turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"Nature does not ask permission to reclaim what is hers."*

## Image Prompt
> Sylvok Rejection — Instant. Action depicted: A creature surging with primal Tangle energy, copper vines and living metal growth erupting from its form in defensive fury. Setting: The Tangle combat, copper trees bending toward the empowered defender. Focal point: The moment of transformation as nature's power floods through chrome-laced muscles. Mood: Grim determination. Style reference: Rebecca Guay.

## Design Notes
- Green combat trick at common
- Simple and efficient giant growth variant
- Fills instant-speed effects gap in green
- Pairs with: [[Tangle's Vengeance]], [[Primal Surge]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Heroic creatures (triggers heroic), Infect creatures (lethal with small infect bodies), Double strike creatures (6 extra damage)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - This is literally [[Giant Growth]] for 1G instead of G. Slightly worse but still common-appropriate. Basic combat trick.
