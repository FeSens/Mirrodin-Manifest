## Card Type Line

## Flavor Text
> *"The Lattice sees all. So do I."*

## Image Prompt
> Lattice Infiltrator, Human Rogue from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Seat of the Synod — slipping between streams of data within the En-Vidia Lattice's core. Mood: Suspicion, calculated stealth. Pose: Moving low and fast, body phasing partially into the data stream, surveillance nodes scanning past without detection. Key visual elements: Hooded figure with chrome-threaded cloak that bends data around them, iron-veined hands touching streams of information, eyes gleaming with stolen knowledge. Style reference: Nils Hamm. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, deep shadows, faint cyan data-trails.

## Design Notes
- Blue common creature - addresses Blue common gap (-4)
- Unblockable with scry reward for NWO compliance
- Scry synergizes with [[🎲 GAMBLE]]
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]]
- Pairs with: [[Data Collector]], [[The House Edge]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Curious Obsession]] / [[Curiosity]] (card advantage engine), [[Bitterblossom]] / Equipment (power boosting on unblockable), Ninjutsu creatures (perfect enabler), [[Sigil of Sleep]] (repeated bounce with guaranteed hits)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Standard unblockable 1/1 with minor upside. [[Slither Blade]] with scry.
