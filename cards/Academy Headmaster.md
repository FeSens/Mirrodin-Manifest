# Academy Headmaster

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Advisor

## Rules Text
> At the beginning of your end step, create a 1/1 white Human Unforged creature token with a spark counter on it.
>
> Sacrifice three Unforged: Draw three cards and add {B}{B}{B}.
>
> *"Such promising students. Such generous donors."*

## Flavor Text
> *"The Spark Refinement Academy produces graduates of exceptional... value."*

## Image Prompt
> A well-dressed headmaster standing before an academy building, smiling warmly while gesturing young figures inside. Behind the gleaming facade, shadows suggest something darker. False legitimacy.

## Design Notes
- Creates Unforged each turn (recruitment)
- Mass sacrifice for cards and mana (trafficking)
- Represents the fake "academies" from [[Lore#The Unforged (Trafficked Victims)]]
- Orzhov colors for institutional corruption
- Pairs with: [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]], [[Spark Harvester]], [[Unforged Witness]], [[The Black Ledger]]
- Counter synergy: Spark counters on Unforged tokens synergize with [[Hype Cycle]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Blood Artist]]/[[Zulaport Cutthroat]] each Unforged death drains opponents; [[Anointed Procession]] doubles token production; [[Skullclamp]] equip to 1/1 tokens, sacrifice, draw 2
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Phyrexian Altar]] + [[Blood Artist]] = sacrifice 3 Unforged for BBB, drain 3 life, make new token each turn; [[Ashnod's Altar]] + [[Nim Deathmantle]] creates repeatable loops
- **Balance Assessment:** BROKEN - Guaranteed token every end step PLUS card draw AND mana from sacrifice is too much value in one card. Consider removing the mana generation or requiring more tokens to sacrifice
