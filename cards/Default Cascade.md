# Default Cascade

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> Whenever a [[Debt Token|Debt token]] is destroyed or sacrificed, its controller creates a new Debt token. This ability triggers only once each turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"Pay one debt, create another."*

## Image Prompt
> Default Cascade — Enchantment. Visual focus: A cascade of falling debt contracts, each one spawning two more as it's destroyed — an endless waterfall of obligation. Setting: Vault of Whispers/Dross Dominion — financial abyss chamber. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Style reference: Seb McKinnon meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Near-black, dark red contracts, olive shadows.

## Design Notes
- Rakdos uncommon enchantment
- Prevents easy debt escape
- Creates cascading debt (pay one, get another)
- Financial doom trap
- Works against [[Bankruptcy Filing]], [[Jubilee Declaration]]
- Pairs with: [[Interest Rate Hike]], [[Vulture Capitalist]]
- **Restriction added:** "Once each turn" clause prevents infinite debt loops with Debt Ceiling and similar effects that would create inescapable lock states

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Debt Ceiling (creates 2 Debts with 3 counters each instead of 1 with 1 counter), Any Debt creator (locks opponent in perpetual Debt), [[Tergrid, God of Fright]] (if opponent sacrifices permanents, you benefit)
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** Debt Ceiling + Default Cascade creates an INESCAPABLE DEBT LOCK. Opponent loses 3-6+ life per upkeep and can never be free of Debt. Combined with Hype Cycle (doubles counters), this becomes lethal in 2-3 turns. With [[Blood Artist]] / [[Zulaport Cutthroat]]: Each Debt sacrifice drains 1 life on top of the Debt damage.
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN - With Debt Ceiling, this is a near-hard lock. Opponent cannot escape Debt through normal means. Every Debt sacrificed creates 2 more bigger Debts. Recommend adding "if this isn't the first time a Debt was sacrificed this turn" clause or making it trigger only on opponent's Debts.
