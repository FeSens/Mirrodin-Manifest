# Default Cascade

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> Whenever a [[Debt Token|Debt token]] is destroyed or sacrificed, its controller creates a new Debt token.

## Flavor Text
> *"Pay one debt, create another."*

## Image Prompt
> A cascade of falling debt contracts, each one spawning two more as it's destroyed. An endless waterfall of financial obligation that can never be escaped. Sisyphean debt trap, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- Rakdos uncommon enchantment
- Prevents easy debt escape
- Creates cascading debt (pay one, get another)
- Financial doom trap
- Works against [[Bankruptcy Filing]], [[Jubilee Declaration]]
- Pairs with: [[Interest Rate Hike]], [[Vulture Capitalist]]
