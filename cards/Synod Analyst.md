## Image Prompt
> Synod Analyst, Vedalken Advisor from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Seat of the Synod data chamber — floating chrome screens projecting analysis. Mood: Suspicion. Pose: Seated in contemplation, four hands each manipulating different data streams, studying patterns within patterns. Key visual elements: Blue Vedalken skin with chrome circuitry at temples, multiple floating screens showing probability calculations, the faint glow of scry magic in eyes. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan data streams.

## Design Notes
- Blue utility creature with repeatable scry
- Supports Gamble mechanic consistently
- Simple tap ability for NWO compliance
- Pairs with: [[Synod High Chancellor]], [[🎲 GAMBLE]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Intruder Alarm]] (untap on creature ETB), [[Aphetto Alchemist]] / [[Fatestitcher]] (untap for more scry), [[Jace's Sanctum]] (spell cost reduction)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Similar to [[Sage of Epityr]] but repeatable at tap cost. Balanced common.
