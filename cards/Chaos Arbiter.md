## Image Prompt
> Chaos Arbiter, Elemental from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Above the Great Furnace — floating in the smoke and ember-filled sky. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Pose: Arms spread wide, commanding chaos around it. Key visual elements: Body of swirling fire and lightning, chrome skeleton visible within flames, coins orbiting like planets. Style reference: Seb McKinnon meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Furnace orange, electric blue, molten gold.

## Design Notes
- Red mythic - addresses Red mythic gap (-3)
- Coin flip for variance/gambling theme
- Direct synergy with [[🎲 GAMBLE]] mechanic
- Spell doubling for exciting gameplay
- Pairs with: [[The House Edge]], [[Bubble Speculator]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Scry 2 lets you set up high mana value cards on top to win gambles; [[Sensei's Divining Top]] for top manipulation
- **Potential Combos:** Top-deck manipulation + high CMC cards improves gamble odds significantly
- **Balance Assessment:** FIXED - Now uses the set's Gamble mechanic (compare mana values) instead of coin flip, and made optional ("you may gamble"). The scry 2 ability helps set up winning gambles. At 5 mana mythic, this is powerful but fair - you need to build around it with high mana value cards.
