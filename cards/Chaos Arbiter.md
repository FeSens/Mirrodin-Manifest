# Chaos Arbiter

## Card Type Line
Creature — Elemental

## Rules Text
> Flying
>
> Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell, flip a coin. If you win the flip, copy that spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.
>
> *GAMBLE — At the beginning of your upkeep, scry 2.*

## Flavor Text
> *"In chaos, there is profit—if you know when to bet."*

## Image Prompt
> A being made of swirling fire and lightning, coins orbiting it like planets, each flip determining fates.

## Design Notes
- Red mythic - addresses Red mythic gap (-3)
- Coin flip for variance/gambling theme
- Direct synergy with [[🎲 GAMBLE]] mechanic
- Spell doubling for exciting gameplay
- Pairs with: [[The House Edge]], [[Bubble Speculator]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Insane with [[Krark's Thumb]] - 75% chance to copy every spell; [[Krark, the Thumbless]] creates double coin flip effects; [[Tavern Scoundrel]] generates Treasures on wins
- **POTENTIALLY BROKEN Combos:** [[Krark's Thumb]] + cheap cantrips = high probability of copying draw spells repeatedly; [[Bonus Round]] + this = doubled spells that might also copy from the flip; [[Twinning Staff]] copies the copies for additional value
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN - Every instant/sorcery potentially being doubled with no mana cost is extremely powerful. With Krark's Thumb, this becomes near-guaranteed copy engine. Unlike Krark, you never lose the spell. Consider requiring mana payment or making the copy effect once per turn
