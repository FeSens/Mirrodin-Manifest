# Nature's Rebalancing

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Redistribute among any number of creatures you control. *(For each pair, remove all counters from them, then each gets half that many counters, rounded down.)*
>
> Then put a +1/+1 counter on each creature that had counters redistributed to it.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Tangle knows no hierarchy. Only balance."*

## Image Prompt
> Nature's Rebalancing — Sorcery. Action depicted: Copper-threaded vines pulse with emerald energy, transferring glowing essence between creatures of varying sizes until all glow equally. Setting: A Tangle clearing where nature enforces balance. Focal point: The connecting vines forming a web of shared power. Mood: Grim determination, forced equality. Style reference: Rebecca Guay meets Terese Nielsen. Color palette: Copper, forest green, olive, soft emerald glow.

## Design Notes
- Green uncommon sorcery - addresses Green uncommon gap (-13)
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] synergy - Green's unique take
- Mass redistribute with bonus +1/+1 counters
- Helps even out your board while adding value
- Green almost never gets Redistribute, this is the exception
- Pairs with [[Tangle Reclaimer]], [[Central Planner]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Hardened Scales]]/[[Branching Evolution]] adds extra counters per redistribution; [[Conclave Mentor]] same effect, plus gains life when it dies; [[Doubling Season]] doubles all counters placed
- **Potential Combos:** Hydra tribal - move counters around hydras, each gets a bonus counter; [[Walking Ballista]]/[[Hangarback Walker]] + counter doublers grow while maintaining other creatures; Modular creatures - redistribute modular counters for value
- **Balance Assessment:** Balanced - only affects your creatures, sorcery speed, and costs 3 mana
