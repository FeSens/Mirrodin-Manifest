# Protest March

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Create two 1/1 white Citizen creature tokens.

## Flavor Text
> *"We are many. They cannot ignore us all."*

## Image Prompt
> Protest March — Sorcery. Action depicted: A tide of citizens with iron-veined skin marching through chrome streets, improvised banners held high, faces showing unified determination. Setting: Mer-Ikan Foundry plaza, towers of authority looming in background. Focal point: The mass of humanity moving as one against gleaming oppressive architecture. Mood: Genuine hope, collective resolve. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Golds, bronze, citizen earth tones against cold chrome, banner whites.

## Design Notes
- White token creator at common
- Simple sorcery for NWO compliance
- Supports go-wide and Citizen tribal strategies
- Pairs with: [[Civilian Militia]], [[Opposition Leader]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Anointed Procession]] (four tokens instead of two), [[Cathars' Crusade]] (each token makes all creatures bigger), [[Divine Visitation]] (two 4/4 angels instead), [[Mentor of the Meek]] (draw 2 cards)
- **Potential Combos:** Standard token combos with [[Ashnod's Altar]] + [[Nim Deathmantle]] (but these aren't recursive on their own). [[Kykar, Wind's Fury]] (not a noncreature spell, so no spirit)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - 3 mana for two 1/1s is below rate (compare to Raise the Alarm at 2 mana instant). This is sorcery speed and costs more. Fine for common.
