## Card Type Line
Creature — Elf Druid

## Rules Text
> {T}: Add {G}.
>
> Whenever you win a gamble, untap Fortune's Gardener and put a +1/+1 counter on it. *(To gamble, you and target opponent reveal the top card of your libraries. Whoever reveals the card with greater mana value wins.)*

## Flavor Text
> *"The Tangle favors those who take chances."*

## Image Prompt
> Fortune's Gardener, Elf Druid from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Tangle — copper grove with fortune-touched plants. Mood: Genuine hope. Pose: Kneeling among metallic plants, dice-shaped seeds in iron-veined hands. Key visual elements: Chrome-boned elf with copper-tinted skin, lucky plants growing tall around them, +1/+1 growth visible on stems. Style reference: Rebecca Guay meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Copper, forest green, olive, gold seed highlights.

## Design Notes
- Green uncommon creature - addresses Green uncommon gap (-13, critical!)
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] synergy - rewards winning gambles with mana and growth
- Mana dork that scales with luck
- +1/+1 counters synergize with [[Hype Cycle]] and [[COMPOUND]]
- Pairs with [[The House Edge]], [[Opportunistic Growth]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Krark's Thumb]] gives 75% chance to untap and get a counter per gamble; [[Umbral Mantle]]/[[Staff of Domination]] untap effects combine with won gamble untaps; [[Hardened Scales]] extra counter on each won gamble
- **Potential Combos:** [[Krark's Thumb]] + repeated gamble effects - multiple untaps = multiple mana per turn; With enough gamble wins, this becomes a mana-positive engine; [[Intruder Alarm]] + creature ETBs - untap Fortune's Gardener, tap for mana
- **Balance Assessment:** Balanced - requires winning gambles for the untap, 1/2 body is fragile. Mana ability is fair
