# The Black Ledger

## Card Type Line
Legendary Artifact

## Rules Text
> {T}: Look at the top card of target opponent's library. You may have that player reveal it. If you do, put an evidence counter on The Black Ledger.
>
> {2}, {T}: Name a card. Target opponent reveals their hand. If the named card is in their hand, that player discards it and put an evidence counter on The Black Ledger.
>
> {T}, Sacrifice The Black Ledger: Each opponent reveals their hand. You may cast a spell from among those cards with mana value less than or equal to the number of evidence counters on The Black Ledger without paying its mana cost.

## Flavor Text
> *Every visitor. Every transaction. Every secret.*

## Image Prompt
> An ancient tome bound in blackened chrome, pages edged with dried quicksilver. Names glow faintly on partially visible pages—some scratched out, some still legible. A Redaction-Myr lurks in the shadows, reaching for the book with ink-stained fingers. The book rests on Ep-Styn's desk in his private study on the Isle. Dark blacks, deep purples, and faint golden text glow. MTG card art style, mysterious and incriminating, noir atmosphere.

## Design Notes
- Information-gathering artifact that builds evidence over time
- **Counter synergy:** Evidence counters accumulate, [[Hype Cycle]] doubles them, [[Compound]] accelerates
- Ultimate scales with evidence gathered—more secrets = bigger payoff
- [[Market Crash]] wipes all evidence (cover-up!)
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - Ep-Styn's client list that everyone wants destroyed or revealed
