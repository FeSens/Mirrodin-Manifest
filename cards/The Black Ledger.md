# The Black Ledger

## Card Type Line
Legendary Artifact

## Rules Text
> {T}: Look at the top card of target opponent's library. You may have that player reveal it. If you do, put an evidence counter on The Black Ledger.
>
> {2}, {T}: Name a card. Target opponent reveals their hand. If the named card is in their hand, that player discards it and put an evidence counter on The Black Ledger.
>
> {T}, Sacrifice The Black Ledger: Each opponent reveals their hand. You may cast a spell from among those cards with mana value less than or equal to the number of evidence counters on The Black Ledger without paying its mana cost.

## Flavor Text
> *Every visitor. Every transaction. Every secret.*

## Image Prompt
> The Black Ledger — Legendary Artifact. Visual focus: An ancient tome bound in blackened chrome with quicksilver-edged pages. Setting: Ep-Styn's private study on the Silent Isle — shadows and secrets. Focal point: Names glowing faintly on pages, some scratched out, Redaction-Myr lurking with ink-stained fingers. Mood: Institutional horror. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Near-black, deep purple, faint golden text glow.

## Design Notes
- Information-gathering artifact that builds evidence over time
- **Counter synergy:** Evidence counters accumulate, [[Hype Cycle]] doubles them, [[Compound]] accelerates
- Ultimate scales with evidence gathered—more secrets = bigger payoff
- [[Market Crash]] wipes all evidence (cover-up!)
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - Ep-Styn's client list that everyone wants destroyed or revealed

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Proliferate effects ([[Inexorable Tide]], [[Contagion Engine]]), [[Doubling Season]]
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** Accumulate counters, sacrifice to free-cast opponent's best spell; with proliferate can rapidly scale
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Requires significant setup and sacrifice payoff is opponent-dependent
