# Glimmervoid Lobbyist

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Advisor

## Rules Text
> {T}: Put a favor counter on target creature. That creature gains hexproof until end of turn.

## Image Prompt
> Glimmervoid Lobbyist, Human Advisor from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Mer-Ikan Foundry — a gilded corridor outside the chambers of power. Mood: False promise, suspicion. Pose: Leaning close to whisper, one hand discreetly placing a gold coin into a powerful figure's robes. Key visual elements: Fine chrome-thread clothing, favor tokens glinting in pockets, the Glimmervoid's golden spires visible through windows. Style reference: Greg Staples. Color palette: Golds, bronze, dark red accents, white marble.

## Design Notes
- Puts favor counters on legendaries (influence)
- Grants hexproof (protection from accountability)
- Counter synergy: Favor counters enable evasion (above the law), [[Hype Cycle]] doubles, [[COMPOUND]] adds
- Common politician enabler
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Glimmervoid Rally (Gold Rally)]] - political lobbying
- Pairs with: [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[Synod High Chancellor]], [[Vault Shadow-Broker]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Kodama of the East Tree]] (protect and make unblockable), [[Thrun, the Last Troll]] (more hexproof redundancy), [[Skullbriar, the Walking Grave]] (counters stick across zones)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Weak body, tap ability, requires legendary. Balanced support card.
