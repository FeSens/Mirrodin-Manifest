# Glimmervoid Lobbyist

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Advisor

## Rules Text
> {T}, Put a favor counter on target legendary creature: That creature gains hexproof until end of turn.
>
> Legendary creatures with favor counters on them can't be blocked by creatures with power 2 or less.

## Flavor Text
> *"My clients' interests are, of course, completely aligned with the public good."*

## Image Prompt
> A well-dressed human whispering into the ear of a powerful figure, placing a coin in their pocket. The Glimmervoid gleams behind them. Influence for sale.

## Design Notes
- Puts favor counters on legendaries (influence)
- Grants hexproof (protection from accountability)
- Counter synergy: Favor counters enable evasion (above the law), [[Hype Cycle]] doubles, [[COMPOUND]] adds
- Common politician enabler
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Glimmervoid Rally (Gold Rally)]] - political lobbying
- Pairs with: [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[Synod High Chancellor]], [[Vault Shadow-Broker]]
