## Flavor Text
> *"It was like my head was exploding from the inside. We all started bleeding. We fell to the ground, unable to move."*
> — Surviving guard, Fuerte Tiuna

## Image Prompt
> Resonance Disruptor — Artifact. Visual focus: A chrome military device on a darksteel tripod, emitting concentric sound waves that distort the air. Setting: Mer-Ikan military installation, emergency red lights casting harsh shadows. Mood: Institutional horror. Key visual elements: Sharp angular construction, exposed En-Vidia processing cores pulsing with charge counters, soldiers with chrome bone structures clutching their heads in agony. Style reference: Mark Tedin.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Reports of a "sonic weapon" used during Operation Absolute Resolve that allegedly left Venezuelan guards bleeding and vomiting
- **Counter synergy:** Charge counters fuel uses OR power up the sacrifice
- [[Hype Cycle]] doubles charges (2→4→8) for massive sacrifice damage
- [[Compound]] lets you build charge while using the small ability
- Choice: spend charges for control, or save them for the nuke
- **Quote is adapted from:** Venezuelan guard testimony reported by multiple outlets
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - military technology
- Pairs with: [[Foundry Strike Team]], [[Operation Absolute Resolve]], [[Terrified Survivor]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Proliferate ([[Karn's Bastion]], [[Inexorable Tide]] - add more charge counters for bigger nuke), [[Voltaic Key]] (untap to use abilities more often), [[Clock of Omens]] (repeated untaps with artifact-heavy decks), [[Rings of Brighthearth]] (copy the activated abilities)
- **Potential Combos:** [[Mechanized Production]] on Resonance Disruptor (create copies, sacrifice all for mass damage)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - 4 mana with limited charges. The sacrifice nuke requires setup and only deals 2 damage baseline.
