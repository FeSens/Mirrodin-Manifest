# Operation Absolute Resolve

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> This spell can't be countered.
>
> Destroy all artifacts target opponent controls. Exile up to one target legendary creature that player controls. You may cast that card for as long as it remains exiled, and you may spend mana as though it were mana of any color to cast it.

## Flavor Text
> *"We reached him within three minutes. Within five, he was ours."*

## Image Prompt
> Operation Absolute Resolve — Sorcery. Action depicted: Elite Foundry soldiers in chrome power armor fast-roping from thopters into a fortified compound as explosions shatter defenses. A terrified figure in ornate robes is dragged from the chaos. Setting: Night assault on an enemy stronghold. Focal point: The captured leader being extracted as the world burns around them. Mood: Grim determination, surgical precision amid chaos. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Raymond Swanland. Color palette: Golds, bronze, explosion orange, night sky, military chrome.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Operation Absolute Resolve, January 3, 2026 — the U.S. Delta Force raid that captured Maduro
- **Lore adaptation:** A Mer-Ikan Foundry decapitation strike against a rival power
- "Can't be countered" represents the overwhelming force and surprise
- Destroying artifacts represents the bombing of infrastructure and air defenses
- Exiling the legendary creature and being able to cast it represents "capturing" the leader and using them (extradition, trial, leverage)
- The mana cost is significant but the effect is game-changing
- **Timeline reference:** Delta Force reached Maduro in 3 minutes, had him in custody in 5
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - military operations
- Pairs with: [[Foundry Strike Team]], [[Resonance Disruptor]], [[Lattice Blackout]], [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Ramp strategies help cast this earlier; [[Boseiju, Who Shelters All]] redundant uncounterability
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** Exile and cast opponent's COMMANDER - essentially steal their commander permanently; In artifact-heavy metas, destroying all opponent artifacts is devastating
- **Balance Assessment:** VERY POWERFUL - Can't be countered + destroy all artifacts + permanently steal legendary creature is an enormous swing. The ability to cast exiled commanders bypasses commander tax entirely. Consider making it "exile until this card leaves the battlefield" or "target noncommander legendary creature"
