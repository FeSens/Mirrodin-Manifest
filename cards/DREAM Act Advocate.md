# DREAM Act Advocate

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Advisor

## Rules Text
> When DREAM Act Advocate enters the battlefield, put a protection counter on each Citizen creature you control.
>
> Citizen creatures with protection counters on them have "When this creature would be exiled, instead remove a protection counter from it."
>
> *"These children know no other home. This is their home."*

## Flavor Text
> *"The path to citizenship should not require perfection."*

## Image Prompt
> An advocate speaking passionately before a Synod tribunal, gesturing toward young people in the gallery. Fighting for belonging.

## Design Notes

- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles protection counters, [[COMPOUND]] extends coverage
- Represents DACA/DREAM Act advocacy
- Azorius legal protection theme
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - advocacy against deportation
- Pairs with: [[Sanctuary City Warden]], [[Asylum Seeker]], [[Hidden Community Elder]]
