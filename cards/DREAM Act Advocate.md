# DREAM Act Advocate

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Advisor

## Rules Text
> When DREAM Act Advocate enters the battlefield, put a protection counter on each Citizen creature you control.
>
> Citizen creatures with protection counters on them have "When this creature would be exiled, instead remove a protection counter from it."
>
> *"These children know no other home. This is their home."*

## Flavor Text
> *"The path to citizenship should not require perfection."*

## Image Prompt
> DREAM Act Advocate, Human Advisor from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Seat of the Synod/Mer-Ikan court — tribunal hearing chamber. Mood: Genuine hope. Pose: Standing passionately before tribunal, arms outstretched gesturing toward young citizens in gallery. Key visual elements: Metallic hair catching light, iron-veined face showing conviction, young hopeful faces in background. Style reference: Rebecca Guay meets Greg Staples. Color palette: White, steel blue, warm highlights on faces.

## Design Notes
- Protection counters prevent exile (once)
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles protection counters, [[COMPOUND]] extends coverage
- Represents DACA/DREAM Act advocacy
- Azorius legal protection theme
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - advocacy against deportation
- Pairs with: [[Sanctuary City Warden]], [[Asylum Seeker]], [[Hidden Community Elder]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Proliferate (add more protection counters), Citizen token generators (protect wide boards), [[Cathars' Crusade]] (already going wide with Citizens)
- **Potential Combos:** With [[Solemnity]]: DOES NOT BREAK THE CARD - Solemnity prevents counters being PLACED, not removed. Citizens would have 0 protection counters and no replacement effect.
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Niche protection for a specific creature type in-set. Parasitic to Citizen tribal.
