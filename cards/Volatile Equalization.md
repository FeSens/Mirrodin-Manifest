# Volatile Equalization

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Redistribute among two target creatures. Volatile Equalization deals 1 damage to each of them.

## Flavor Text
> *"Balance through destruction."*

## Design Notes
- Red common sorcery - REDISTRIBUTE with damage
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] synergy
- Can be used as pseudo-removal with right setup
