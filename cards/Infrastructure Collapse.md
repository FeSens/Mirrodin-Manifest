# Infrastructure Collapse

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Destroy all artifacts. For each artifact destroyed this way, its controller creates a [[Debt Token|Debt token]].

## Flavor Text
> *"The bill for progress came due all at once."*

## Image Prompt
> Infrastructure Collapse — Sorcery. Action depicted: The En-Vidia Lattice exploding outward, data towers crumbling, processing cores shattering into shrapnel, Myr collapsing mid-stride as Debt tokens materialize around devastated figures. Setting: The Seat of the Synod, infrastructure failing catastrophically. Focal point: The central Lattice node mid-detonation. Mood: Institutional horror, catastrophic consequence. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Steel blue shattering into furnace orange, chrome debris, red warning runes.

## Design Notes
- Red rare artifact sweeper
- Mass artifact destruction + mass debt creation
- [[Lore]] connection: En-Vidia Lattice collapse
- Symmetrical but can be built around
- Devastating in artifact-heavy metagames
- Pairs with: [[Compute Debt]], [[Trough of Disillusionment]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Mycosynth Lattice]] (all permanents are artifacts - destroy everything, everyone gets massive Debt), [[Vandalblast]] (comparison - one-sided but no Debt), [[Bane of Progress]] (similar mass removal)
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Mycosynth Lattice]] + Infrastructure Collapse = Destroy ALL permanents (including lands). Everyone gets Debt tokens equal to their permanents. Follow up with Debt-damage effects to kill table.
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN - Same Mycosynth Lattice issue as Furnace Revolution. This one at least damages you too, but in artifact-light builds you come out ahead.
