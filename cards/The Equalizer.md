# The Equalizer

## Card Type Line
Creature — Vedalken Advisor

## Rules Text
> Whenever one or more permanents are redistributed, scry 2.
>

## Flavor Text
> *"Perfect balance requires perfect information."*

## Image Prompt
> The Equalizer, Vedalken Advisor from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Seat of the Synod — sterile chrome chamber with data streams. Mood: Institutional horror. Pose: Standing with precisely balanced scales, redistributing counters with mathematical precision. Key visual elements: Chrome-touched blue skin, scales holding glowing counters, data streams flowing behind, cold calculating gaze. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan data streams.

## Design Notes
- **Redistribute hub** - triggers on ANY redistribute effect
- Connects: [[Redistribute the Wealth]], [[Vindictive Redistribution]], [[Forced Equalization]], [[Grove of Equal Measure]], [[Nature's Rebalancing]], [[Equality Enforcer]], [[Spite Redistributor]], [[The Grand Equalizer]]
- Flexible redistribute ability (not just two permanents)
- Scry triggers synergize with [[🎲 GAMBLE]] and [[The House Edge]]
- Azorius (W/U) for political/bureaucratic theme
- Pairs with [[Central Planner]], [[Mak-Ron, the Glass Orator]]
- **Restriction added:** "permanents you control" prevents infinite persist combos by stopping you from removing -1/-1 counters from opponent's persist creatures or moving counters to opponents

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Doubling Season]], [[Hardened Scales]], [[Winding Constrictor]], [[The Ozolith]]
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** With persist creatures ([[Kitchen Finks]], [[Murderous Redcap]]), can remove -1/-1 counters and redistribute as +1/+1 elsewhere - infinite persist with a sac outlet
- **Balance Assessment:** FIXED - Changed to "permanents you control" only, preventing persist combo exploitation with opponent's creatures
