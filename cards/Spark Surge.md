# Spark Surge

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Target creature gets +2/+0 and gains first strike until end of turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"Strike first. Strike hard. Strike once."*

## Image Prompt
> Spark Surge — Instant. Action depicted: A warrior with chrome-reinforced skeleton surrounded by crackling furnace energy, their weapon blazing with sudden power. Setting: The Great Furnace combat arena, molten metal channels below. Focal point: The weapon's edge igniting with first-strike fury. Mood: Buried rage unleashed. Style reference: Kev Walker. Color palette: Furnace orange, copper, blazing white edge.

## Design Notes
- Red combat trick at common
- Simple and efficient design
- Supports aggressive strategies
- Pairs with: [[Furnace Runner]], [[Spark Harvester]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Double strike creatures (first strike redundant, but +2 power helps), [[Feather, the Redeemed]] (return to hand on cast), [[Zada, Hedron Grinder]] (copy to all creatures), Heroic triggers (standard pump spell synergy)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Slightly below [[Titan's Strength]] (no scry). Appropriately costed common.
