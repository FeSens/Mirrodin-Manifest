# Keeper of the Guest List

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Advisor

## Rules Text
> Whenever a legendary creature enters the battlefield under an opponent's control, put a name counter on Keeper of the Guest List.
>
> {B}, {T}, Remove X name counters from Keeper of the Guest List: Target opponent discards X cards. Activate only as a sorcery.

## Flavor Text
> *"Everyone who visited. Every favor exchanged. All recorded."*

## Image Prompt
> A gaunt figure in black robes sitting at a desk, quill in hand, adding names to an endless scroll. The scroll glows faintly with the weight of secrets. Visitors' silhouettes line up behind them.

## Design Notes
- Tracks legendary creatures (the powerful visitors)
- Name counters fuel discard (blackmail)
- Hype Cycle doubles name counters for massive discard
- The guest list keeper for [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]]
