## Image Prompt
> Keeper of the Guest List, Human Advisor from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Dross Dominion — a dimly lit archive chamber within Ep-Styn's Silent Isle. Mood: Institutional horror, suspicion. Pose: Seated at a chrome desk, quill scratching across an endless scroll, eyes cataloging without looking up. Key visual elements: Gaunt face with iron-veined skin, name counters glowing as entries on the scroll, silhouettes of powerful visitors queuing in shadows. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Near-black, dark olive, faint necrogen glow, scroll-light.

## Design Notes
- Tracks legendary creatures (the powerful visitors)
- Name counters fuel discard (blackmail)
- Hype Cycle doubles name counters for massive discard
- The guest list keeper for [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Donate]] / [[Harmless Offering]] + [[Phage the Untouchable]] (force legendary creatures to opponents), [[Panharmonicon]] (double triggers when opponents' legends enter), [[Captain Sisay]] decks (naturally accrues counters in legend-heavy metas)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Slow to build, requires opponents to play specific card types, sorcery speed activation limits abuse.
