# Unforged Witness

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Unforged

## Rules Text
> Unforged Witness enters the battlefield with a testimony counter on it.
>
> When Unforged Witness enters the battlefield, look at the top card of target opponent's library. You may reveal it. If a legendary card is revealed this way, put a testimony counter on Unforged Witness.
>
> Sacrifice Unforged Witness: Reveal the top X cards of target opponent's library, where X is the number of testimony counters on it. Your opponents can't cast legendary spells until your next turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"They told me I was special. That I had potential. They were right—I was currency."*

## Image Prompt
> Unforged Witness, Human Unforged from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Synod tribunal chamber — courtroom of power confronted. Mood: Grim determination. Pose: Standing before shadowy council, accusatory finger pointing, torn Ledger page held as evidence. Key visual elements: Dimmed flickering spark-light in young eyes, council members recoiling in obscured faces, ornate regalia of the guilty visible. Style reference: Rebecca Guay meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Pale whites and grays, dying golden spark-light, shadowy council robes.

## Design Notes
- **Counter synergy:** Testimony counters grow, scaling the reveal on sacrifice
- [[Hype Cycle]] doubles testimony counters → expose more secrets
- [[Compound]] lets testimony build before speaking out
- [[Market Crash]] silences all witnesses (removes testimony counters)
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - Survivors of Ep-Styn's trafficking
- The Unforged creature type marks them as victims

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Proliferate, [[Doubling Season]], flicker effects
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Information and legendary lockout is niche
