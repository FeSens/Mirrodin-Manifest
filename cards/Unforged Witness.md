# Unforged Witness

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Unforged

## Rules Text
> Unforged Witness enters the battlefield with a testimony counter on it.
>
> When Unforged Witness enters the battlefield, look at the top card of target opponent's library. You may reveal it. If a legendary card is revealed this way, put a testimony counter on Unforged Witness.
>
> Sacrifice Unforged Witness: Reveal the top X cards of target opponent's library, where X is the number of testimony counters on it. Your opponents can't cast legendary spells until your next turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"They told me I was special. That I had potential. They were right—I was currency."*

## Image Prompt
> A young human figure with dimmed, flickering spark-light in their eyes, standing before a council of shadowy figures. They point an accusatory finger while holding a torn page from the Black Ledger. The council members recoil, their faces obscured but their ornate regalia visible. Pale whites and grays with flickers of dying golden light. MTG card art style, courtroom drama, tense atmosphere.

## Design Notes
- **Counter synergy:** Testimony counters grow, scaling the reveal on sacrifice
- [[Hype Cycle]] doubles testimony counters → expose more secrets
- [[Compound]] lets testimony build before speaking out
- [[Market Crash]] silences all witnesses (removes testimony counters)
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - Survivors of Ep-Styn's trafficking
- The Unforged creature type marks them as victims
