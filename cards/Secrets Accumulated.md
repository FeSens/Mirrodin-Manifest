Enchantment

## Flavor Text
> *"Every secret is currency. Every name, a weapon."*

## Image Prompt
> Secrets Accumulated — Enchantment. Visual focus: A black tome chained to a darksteel pedestal, pages glowing with accumulated names and secrets. Setting: Vault of Whispers archive chamber, shadows pooling in every corner. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Key visual elements: Secrecy counters orbiting like dark fireflies, chains of blackened chrome binding the book, each page revealing different counter types as hidden currencies of power. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: Near-black, dark olive, faint necrogen glow on text.

## Design Notes
- **Secrecy counter hub** - accumulates from all counter types
- Connects: [[Isle Procurer]], [[Keeper of the Guest List]], [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]], [[Ledger Thief]]
- Counter diversity rewards running multiple counter types
- Synergizes with [[Hype Cycle]] (doubles secrecy counters)
- Synergizes with [[Market Crash]] (lose all secrets = cover-up)
- Pairs with [[The Black Ledger]], [[Control The Narrative]], [[Veiled Client]]
- Black's theme: information is power

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Doubling Season]] doubles secrecy counters placed; [[Proliferate effects]] add more secrecy counters; [[Hardened Scales]] extra counters on all counter placement
- **POTENTIALLY BROKEN Combos:** [[Heliod, Sun-Crowned]] + [[Walking Ballista]] infinite +1/+1 counters = infinite secrecy counters; [[Devoted Druid]] + [[Vizier of Remedies]] infinite -1/-1 counters placed = infinite secrecy; [[Mikaeus, the Unhallowed]] + persist creature infinite death/undying triggers with counters
- **Balance Assessment:** FIXED - Added "Once each turn" to prevent infinite secrecy counter generation from infinite counter combos.
