## Image Prompt
> Synod's Rejection — Instant. Action depicted: A Vedalken bureaucrat with chrome-traced skull stamping "DENIED" on glowing documents as a creature dissolves back into aether mist. Setting: Seat of the Synod processing office, endless filing cabinets behind. Focal point: The stamp striking paper as the creature begins to fade. Mood: Institutional horror. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, fading creature colors.

## Design Notes
- Blue common instant - addresses Blue common gap (-11)
- Simple bounce + scry for NWO compliance
- Scry synergizes with [[🎲 GAMBLE]] (stack deck before gambling)
- Core Blue removal at common
- Pairs with: [[The House Edge]], [[Mak-Ron, the Glass Orator]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Snapcaster Mage]] (flashback bounce), [[Naban, Dean of Iteration]] (double triggers with Wizards), [[Dream Eater]] (tempo)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Unsummon with upside at common is appropriate; similar to [[Blink of an Eye]]
