## Design Notes
- WU signpost uncommon for flyers archetype
- Tempo play with flying body
- Supports evasive strategies
- Pairs with: [[Synod High Chancellor]], [[Sanctuary Guardian]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Panharmonicon]] (tap two creatures), Flickering (repeated tempo plays), [[Ephara, God of the Polis]] (card draw on ETB), [[Reflector Mage]] (similar tempo strategies)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Flying 2/2 for 2 with tap effect is aggressive but not broken. Good signpost uncommon.
