# Supreme Arbiter of Order

## Card Type Line
Legendary Creature — Vedalken Advisor

## Rules Text
> Flying, vigilance
>
> At the beginning of each opponent's upkeep, that player chooses a nonland permanent they control. Tap all other nonland permanents that player controls.
>
> *"Order is not requested. It is enforced."*

## Flavor Text
> *"I speak for the Synod. The Synod speaks for all."*

## Image Prompt
> A towering Vedalken in ceremonial robes hovering above a crowd, gesturing as citizens freeze in compliance.

## Design Notes
- White mythic - addresses White mythic gap (-1)
- Powerful control effect
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Synod of Cognitive Accord]]
- Pairs with: [[Synod High Chancellor]], [[Protocol Enforcer]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Devastating with [[Winter Orb]], [[Static Orb]], [[Stasis]] - opponents can barely untap; [[Smothering Tithe]] generates Treasures while opponents struggle; [[Blind Obedience]] ensures permanents enter tapped
- **POTENTIALLY BROKEN Combos:** [[Stasis]] + this = opponents keep 1 permanent untapped, but Stasis prevents even that from untapping; [[Winter Orb]] + this = opponents effectively can't function; [[Kismet]]/[[Frozen Aether]] + this = permanents enter tapped and mostly stay tapped
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN - Creates near-complete lock with common stax pieces. Opponents keeping only ONE untapped nonland permanent is extremely restrictive. Consider changing to "tap up to two" or limiting to creatures only
