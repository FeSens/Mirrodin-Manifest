# Supreme Arbiter of Order

## Card Type Line
Legendary Creature — Vedalken Advisor

## Rules Text
> Flying, vigilance
>

>

## Flavor Text
> *"I speak for the Synod. The Synod speaks for all."*

## Image Prompt
> Supreme Arbiter of Order, Vedalken Advisor from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Seat of the Synod central plaza — chrome spires and assembled masses below. Mood: Institutional horror. Pose: Hovering above the crowd on invisible force, arms raised in commanding gesture as citizens freeze in terrified compliance. Key visual elements: Elaborate ceremonial robes of white and chrome, four-armed Vedalken physique with each hand directing different areas, eyes glowing with enforced authority. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: White, chrome, steel blue, gold accents.

## Design Notes
- White mythic - addresses White mythic gap (-1)
- Powerful control effect
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Synod of Cognitive Accord]]
- Pairs with: [[Synod High Chancellor]], [[Protocol Enforcer]]
- **Restriction added:** Changed to "tap up to two OTHER" to prevent oppressive locks with Winter Orb/Stasis; tapping only 2 permanents is disruptive but not a complete shutdown, and "other" ensures the Arbiter itself can still be targeted by removal

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Devastating with [[Winter Orb]], [[Static Orb]], [[Stasis]] - opponents can barely untap; [[Smothering Tithe]] generates Treasures while opponents struggle; [[Blind Obedience]] ensures permanents enter tapped
- **POTENTIALLY BROKEN Combos:** [[Stasis]] + this = opponents keep 1 permanent untapped, but Stasis prevents even that from untapping; [[Winter Orb]] + this = opponents effectively can't function; [[Kismet]]/[[Frozen Aether]] + this = permanents enter tapped and mostly stay tapped
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN - Creates near-complete lock with common stax pieces. Opponents keeping only ONE untapped nonland permanent is extremely restrictive. Consider changing to "tap up to two" or limiting to creatures only
