# Expedited Removal Enforcer

## Card Type Line
Artifact Creature — Construct Mer-Ikan

## Rules Text
> Flash
>
> When Expedited Removal Enforcer enters the battlefield, exile target creature an opponent controls. Its controller may pay {3}. If they do, return it to the battlefield under their control at the beginning of the next end step.

## Flavor Text
> *"Due process is for citizens."*

## Image Prompt
> Expedited Removal Enforcer, Construct Mer-Ikan from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Great Furnace/Mer-Ikan Foundry — residential doorway being breached. Mood: Institutional horror. Pose: Bursting through door, chrome arms seizing target before anyone can react. Key visual elements: Massive chrome body, red emergency lights in eyes, door shattered mid-breach, terrified faces in background. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Chrome silver, bronze door fragments, white interior light, dark red emergency glow.

## Design Notes
- Flash exile (surprise deportation)
- Opponent can "pay bail" to get creature back
- Expedited removal = no due process
- Uncommon big Mer-Ikan construct
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - expedited deportation
- Pairs with: [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[Reprocessing Agent]], [[Foundry Border Commander]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Panharmonicon]] (double exile trigger), [[Cloudshift]] / [[Ephemerate]] (blink to exile multiple creatures), [[Leyline of Anticipation]] (already has flash but enables other combos), [[Strionic Resonator]] (copy the ETB for additional exile)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - 5 mana is appropriate for flash exile effect. Opponent has counterplay with the {3} payment.
