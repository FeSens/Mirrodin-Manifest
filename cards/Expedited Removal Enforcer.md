# Expedited Removal Enforcer

## Card Type Line
Artifact Creature — Construct Mer-Ikan

## Rules Text
> Flash
>
> When Expedited Removal Enforcer enters the battlefield, exile target creature an opponent controls. Its controller may pay {3}. If they do, return it to the battlefield under their control at the beginning of the next end step.

## Flavor Text
> *"Due process is for citizens."*

## Image Prompt
> A massive construct bursting through a door, seizing a creature before anyone can react. Speed and force over procedure.

## Design Notes
- Flash exile (surprise deportation)
- Opponent can "pay bail" to get creature back
- Expedited removal = no due process
- Uncommon big Mer-Ikan construct
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - expedited deportation
- Pairs with: [[Tromp, the Gilded Sentinel]], [[Reprocessing Agent]], [[Foundry Border Commander]]
