# Furnace Saboteur

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Rogue

## Rules Text
> Haste
>
> Whenever Furnace Saboteur deals combat damage to a player, that player sacrifices an artifact or discards a card.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Foundry burns brightest when fed its own machines."*

## Image Prompt
> A grinning rogue hurling explosive devices into the Great Furnace machinery, chaos erupting behind them.

## Design Notes
- BR signpost uncommon - aggressive sacrifice/discard theme
- Haste for aggressive starts
- Choice gives flexibility
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]]
- Pairs with: [[Resistance Saboteur]], [[Ledger Thief]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Sword of Feast and Famine]] (protection to guarantee hits + additional discard), [[Specter's Shroud]] (redundant discard trigger), [[Port Razer]] (multiple combat steps = multiple triggers), [[Tinybones, Trinket Thief]] (discard payoff)
- **Potential Combos:** Multiple combat step cards ([[Aggravated Assault]], [[Moraug, Fury of Akoum]]) can drain hands quickly
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Strong Rakdos creature but giving the opponent choice keeps it balanced. Specters and similar exist.
