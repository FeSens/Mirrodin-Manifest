# Rally the Militia

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Creatures you control get +1/+1 until end of turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"For the Foundry! For freedom!"*

## Image Prompt
> Rally the Militia — Instant. Action depicted: A militia commander raising a bronze banner as citizen soldiers with chrome bone structures surge forward. Setting: Mer-Ikan Foundry streets, golden architecture visible behind barricades. Focal point: The banner catching furnace light, rallying the crowd. Mood: Genuine hope. Style reference: Kev Walker.

## Design Notes
- White common instant - addresses White common gap (-5)
- Team pump combat trick
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Sanctions War (The Ukraine War)]]
- Pairs with: [[Civilian Militia]], [[Watchtower Defender]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Works with token strategies using [[Anointed Procession]], [[Parallel Lives]], [[Doubling Season]]; Combines with [[Heroic Intervention]] for protected alpha strikes; Pairs with [[Jeskai Ascendancy]] for prowess triggers
- **Potential Combos:** [[Cathars' Crusade]] each creature entering also gets permanent +1/+1 counters; [[Intangible Virtue]] gives tokens vigilance and +1/+1 stacking with pump; [[Divine Visitation]] decks turn tokens into 4/4 Angels that become 5/5s
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Standard team pump effect at appropriate cost. Similar to [[Inspired Charge]] but cheaper with smaller boost
