## Image Prompt
> Unforged Advocate, Human Cleric from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Hidden sanctuary — between the Vault of Whispers and freedom. Mood: Genuine hope. Pose: Standing protectively before a group of dim-sparked Unforged, hands emanating healing light. Key visual elements: Black and white robes of Orzhov justice, chrome-touched skin glowing with determination, rescued Unforged with flickering sparks behind. Style reference: Rebecca Guay meets Greg Staples. Color palette: White and black robes, dim golden spark-light, sanctuary warmth.

## Design Notes
- **Unforged tribal lord** - buffs all Unforged tokens
- Connects: [[Isle Procurer]], [[Unforged Witness]], [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]], [[Spark Harvester]], [[The Ledger Surfaces]]
- Spark counter synergy - death triggers only if sparked
- Creates replacement Unforged (the rescued become rescuers)
- Orzhov (W/B) - justice for the trafficked
- Pairs with [[Glimmer-Barge]], [[The Black Ledger]]
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles spark counters

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Anointed Procession]] doubles Unforged token creation; [[Divine Visitation]] tokens become 4/4 Angels; [[Soul Warden]]/[[Soul's Attendant]] lifegain from tokens
- **Potential Combos:** [[Ashnod's Altar]] sacrifice Unforged for mana, create replacement if sparked; [[Phyrexian Altar]] colored mana from sacrifices; [[Teysa Karlov]] doubles death triggers
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Tribal lord effect is conditional (Unforged with spark counters). Creates value loops but requires setup
