# Forced Equalization

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Redistribute. *(Choose two permanents. Remove all counters from them, then each gets half that many counters, rounded down.)*
>
> Scry 1.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Lattice calculates optimal distribution. Your preferences are irrelevant."*

## Image Prompt
> Forced Equalization — Instant. Action depicted: A Vedalken bureaucrat adjusting holographic displays, counter bars equalizing to same height. Setting: Seat of the Synod/En-Vidia Lattice — redistribution calculation chamber. Focal point: The moment all display bars reach identical height. Mood: Institutional horror. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan holographic displays.

## Design Notes
- Blue common instant - addresses Blue common gap (-17, highest priority)
- Addresses common creature ratio issue
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] synergy at instant speed
- Scry 1 adds value and synergizes with [[🎲 GAMBLE]]
- Blue gets conditional/political Redistribute
- Pairs with [[The House Edge]], [[Central Planner]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Scry payoffs - triggers "whenever you scry" effects; [[Wizards of Thay]] scry triggers card draw; Counter manipulation - combine with counter-adding effects
- **Potential Combos:** Target opponent's high-counter permanent + your 0-counter permanent - strip their counters; [[Crystalline Crawler]]/[[Everflowing Chalice]] manipulate charge counter artifacts; Instant speed disruption against counter-based win conditions
- **Balance Assessment:** Balanced - 2 mana instant, scry 1 is minor upside
