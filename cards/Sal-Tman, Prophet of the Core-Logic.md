# Sal-Tman, Prophet of the Core-Logic

Legendary Creature — Human Artificer

## Rules Text

## Power/Toughness
> 2/4

## Flavor Text
> *He promised the future. He delivered quarterly reports.*

## Image Prompt
> Sal-Tman, Prophet of the Core-Logic, Human Artificer from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Seat of the Synod — chrome spires rising behind a massive crowd of Vedalken investors. Mood: False promise. Pose: Arms spread wide in messianic gesture, practiced smile on chrome-traced face. Key visual elements: Immaculate white and blue robes, flickering holographic Myr-Mind projection revealing incompleteness beneath its polish, calculating eyes betraying practiced charm. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, pristine white.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI
- **Lore:** Leader of the Thought-Sync movement, perpetually promising AGI
- The Myr tokens can't attack or block—they're impressive but useless (vaporware)
- The mana ability represents massive spending that requires growth to justify
- "Lose 3 life unless you have more artifacts" = spend now, profit later mentality
- 2/4 stats: defensive, a talker not a fighter
- The perpetual "one year away" quote is directly from AGI criticism
- Pairs with: [[The Orb-Seekers]], [[Compute Debt]], [[Sal-Tman's Promise]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Intruder Alarm]] (each Myr token untaps Sal-Tman for more mana), [[Urza, Lord High Artificer]] (tap Myr for additional mana), [[Kuldotha Forgemaster]] (sacrifice useless Myr to tutor artifacts), [[Inspiring Statuary]] (Myr enable improvise)
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** Sal-Tman + [[Intruder Alarm]] + [[Training Grounds]]/[[Heartstone]] (pay 2, make Myr, Myr ETB untaps Sal-Tman, tap for CCC, net +1 mana per cycle - infinite mana and infinite Myr tokens). Sal-Tman + [[Clock of Omens]] (tap 2 Myr to untap Sal-Tman, generate CCC, pay 2 for another Myr - eventually goes infinite with enough Myr)
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN - The 3 colorless mana generation is very powerful. The life loss condition is easily met in artifact decks. Enables infinite mana combos with common artifact support pieces like Intruder Alarm.
