# The Great Leveling

## Card Type Line
Legendary Artifact Creature — Construct

## Rules Text
> Vigilance
>
> When The Great Leveling enters the battlefield, remove all counters from all other permanents. Then distribute that many counters among those permanents as evenly as possible, rounded down.
>
> Whenever one or more counters are put on a permanent, if that permanent has five or more counters on it, redistribute that permanent and another target permanent.

## Flavor Text
> *"No one rises. No one falls. All are equal before the Equalizer."*

## Image Prompt
> The Great Leveling, Legendary Construct from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Great Furnace — central plaza where all are made equal. Mood: Institutional horror. Pose: Standing in perfect balance, scale-arms extended, redistributing everything. Key visual elements: Massive chrome form with literal scales for arms, counters flowing from rich to poor in every direction, cold perfect symmetry, emotionless face. Style reference: Seb McKinnon meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Cold chrome, white institutional light, flowing counter energy.

## Design Notes
- White Mythic - addresses White mythic gap (-3)
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] lord - the ultimate redistribute enabler
- ETB mass redistribution is devastating against counter-heavy boards
- Ongoing effect prevents accumulation
- Hard counter to [[COMPOUND]] and [[Hype Cycle]] strategies
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - enforced equality taken to extreme
- Pairs with: [[Central Planner]], [[Equality Enforcer]], [[Austerity Minister]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Solemnity]] prevents any counters from being placed, locks board state; [[Aura Shards]]/[[Reclamation Sage]] remove opponents' counter-generating permanents; [[Thassa, Deep-Dwelling]]/[[Conjurer's Closet]] flicker to trigger mass redistribution repeatedly
- **Potential Combos:** Devastating against Superfriends decks (strips loyalty counters from all planeswalkers); [[Panharmonicon]] doubles the ETB redistribution; Against Modular/Affinity strategies
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN against counter-heavy strategies. The ongoing effect at end step creates a soft lock. Consider removing the automatic end-step trigger or making it only target opponents' permanents
