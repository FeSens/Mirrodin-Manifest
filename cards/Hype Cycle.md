# Hype Cycle

## Card Type Line
Enchantment — Saga

## Rules Text
> *(As this Saga enters and after your draw step, add a lore counter. Sacrifice after III.)*
>
> **I** — Double the number of counters on each permanent.
>
> **II** — Double the number of counters on each permanent.
>
> **III** — Remove all counters from all permanents.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Lattice promised infinite growth. It delivered infinite zeroes."*
> — Mak-Ron, surveying the crash

## Image Prompt
> Hype Cycle — Enchantment Saga. Visual focus: A triptych showing the cycle — first panel: counters doubling as a holographic graph soars impossibly high; second panel: counters doubling again, the curve reaching heaven; third panel: all counters stripped away, the graph flatlined, Vedalken staring in horror at blank terminals. Setting: The Seat of the Synod, En-Vidia Lattice pulsing in background. Mood: False promise to institutional horror. Style reference: Seb McKinnon meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan, harsh red warning lights.

## Design Notes
- Mechanic: Saga - tells the story of a boom-bust cycle
- Synergy: Explosive with +1/+1 counters, charge counters, loyalty counters
- Risk: Also doubles poison counters, -1/-1 counters on your stuff
- The crash (Chapter III) is symmetrical and devastating
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - References the En-Vidia Lattice and the "Calculated Futures" that promised everything and delivered collapse
- Mak-Ron (Macron) watches his grand plans evaporate like the Quicksilver Sea
- Perfect satire of tech/crypto hype cycles

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider]] quadruples your counters (Vorinclex doubles the doubling); Planeswalkers get 4x loyalty enabling instant ultimates; Charge counter artifacts ([[Everflowing Chalice]], [[Astral Cornucopia]]) generate exponential mana
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Darksteel Reactor]] start at 20, Chapter I = 40, Chapter II = 80 (instant win); [[Helix Pinnacle]] exponential growth toward 100; [[Magistrate's Scepter]] double time counters for extra turns; [[Chisei, Heart of Oceans]]/[[Power Conduit]] stay at Chapter II permanently, avoiding crash
- **Balance Assessment:** EXTREMELY POWERFUL - Doubling ALL counters twice (4x total) enables numerous combo wins. With Vorinclex, this becomes 16x. Chapter III crash can be avoided with counter removal effects. Consider making it only affect creatures or only your permanents
