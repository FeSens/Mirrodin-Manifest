## Image Prompt
> Foundry Strike Team, Human Soldier from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Great Furnace/Mer-Ikan Foundry — target compound breach. Mood: Grim determination. Pose: Four elite soldiers breaching steel door in perfect synchronization, weapons raised. Key visual elements: Chrome-and-white powered armor, green night vision optics glowing, Thopter hovering behind with bay open, smoke and debris mid-explosion. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Greg Staples. Color palette: White armor, chrome, green optics glow, dark smoke.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Delta Force operators who carried out the Maduro capture
- **Lore adaptation:** Elite Mer-Ikan Foundry special operations unit
- Flash represents the surprise strike at 1 a.m.
- First strike represents their training and equipment advantage
- The Banishing Light-style exile represents capturing a high-value target
- The flavor text references Delta Force rehearsing in a full-scale replica of Maduro's compound in Kentucky
- **Quote:** Military Times described the operation as "surgical"
- 3/2 stats: deadly but not invincible (several U.S. troops were wounded)
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - elite special operations unit
- Pairs with: [[Operation Absolute Resolve]], [[Resonance Disruptor]], [[Lattice Blackout]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Ephemerate]] (blink to exile multiple creatures - but loses the original), [[Charming Prince]] (flicker for value), [[Restoration Angel]] (flash blink synergy), [[Fiend Hunter]] (compare: similar effect)
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** O-Ring style exile trick - If you can remove Foundry Strike Team from the battlefield before its ETB resolves ([[Cloudshift]]), the creature is permanently exiled. This is a known interaction with [[Fiend Hunter]].
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Strong but fair. Flash Banishing Light on a body is good at 4 mana. The first strike makes it a reasonable blocker.
