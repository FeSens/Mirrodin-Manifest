>
> First strike

>
> *"This was surgical."*

## Flavor Text
> *They rehearsed the breach a hundred times in a replica forge. On the night, they needed only one.*

## Power/Toughness
> 3/2

## Image Prompt
> Four elite Mer-Ikan soldiers in sleek, angular chrome-and-white powered armor breaching through a steel door. They move in perfect synchronization, weapons raised. Night vision optics glow green on their helmets. Behind them, a thopter hovers with its bay door open. The scene is tense and professional—no wasted motion. Smoke and debris fill the corridor. Mirrodin military aesthetic, tactical precision, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Delta Force operators who carried out the Maduro capture
- **Lore adaptation:** Elite Mer-Ikan Foundry special operations unit
- Flash represents the surprise strike at 1 a.m.
- First strike represents their training and equipment advantage
- The Banishing Light-style exile represents capturing a high-value target
- The flavor text references Delta Force rehearsing in a full-scale replica of Maduro's compound in Kentucky
- **Quote:** Military Times described the operation as "surgical"
- 3/2 stats: deadly but not invincible (several U.S. troops were wounded)
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - elite special operations unit
- Pairs with: [[Operation Absolute Resolve]], [[Resonance Disruptor]], [[Lattice Blackout]]
