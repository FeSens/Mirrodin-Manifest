# Foundry Strike Team

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Soldier

## Rules Text
> Flash
>
> First strike
>
> When Foundry Strike Team enters, exile target creature an opponent controls until Foundry Strike Team leaves the battlefield.
>
> *"This was surgical."*

## Flavor Text
> *They rehearsed the breach a hundred times in a replica forge. On the night, they needed only one.*

## Power/Toughness
> 3/2

## Image Prompt
> Four elite Mer-Ikan soldiers in sleek, angular chrome-and-white powered armor breaching through a steel door. They move in perfect synchronization, weapons raised. Night vision optics glow green on their helmets. Behind them, a thopter hovers with its bay door open. The scene is tense and professional—no wasted motion. Smoke and debris fill the corridor. Mirrodin military aesthetic, tactical precision, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Delta Force operators who carried out the Maduro capture
- **Lore adaptation:** Elite Mer-Ikan Foundry special operations unit
- Flash represents the surprise strike at 1 a.m.
- First strike represents their training and equipment advantage
- The Banishing Light-style exile represents capturing a high-value target
- The flavor text references Delta Force rehearsing in a full-scale replica of Maduro's compound in Kentucky
- **Quote:** Military Times described the operation as "surgical"
- 3/2 stats: deadly but not invincible (several U.S. troops were wounded)
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]] - elite special operations unit
- Pairs with: [[Operation Absolute Resolve]], [[Resonance Disruptor]], [[Lattice Blackout]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Ephemerate]] (blink to exile multiple creatures - but loses the original), [[Charming Prince]] (flicker for value), [[Restoration Angel]] (flash blink synergy), [[Fiend Hunter]] (compare: similar effect)
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** O-Ring style exile trick - If you can remove Foundry Strike Team from the battlefield before its ETB resolves ([[Cloudshift]]), the creature is permanently exiled. This is a known interaction with [[Fiend Hunter]].
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Strong but fair. Flash Banishing Light on a body is good at 4 mana. The first strike makes it a reasonable blocker.
