# Glimmervoid Broker

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Rogue

## Rules Text
> {T}: Gamble. *(You and target opponent reveal the top card of your libraries. Whoever reveals the card with greater mana value wins.)* If you win the gamble, create a Gold token. If you lose the gamble, sacrifice a permanent.

## Flavor Text
> *"The house always wins. I am the house."*

## Image Prompt
> Glimmervoid Broker, Human Rogue from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Glimmervoid — a high-stakes casino floor with gold-topped tables and chrome fixtures. Mood: False promise, corrupted triumph. Pose: Leaning forward with cards fanned, smile frozen in calculated confidence. Key visual elements: Iron-veined hands holding gilded cards, gold tokens stacked nearby, reflective surfaces showing distorted odds. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Gold, white, bright chrome with shadows underneath.

## Design Notes
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] for Gold tokens
- High risk, high reward economy
- Lose = sacrifice (market loss)
- Gambling + economic theme fusion
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Glimmervoid Rally (Gold Rally)]] - gold speculation
- Pairs with: [[The House Edge]], [[Hedge Fund Manager]], [[The Rigged Game]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Sensei's Divining Top]] (rig the gamble), [[Scroll Rack]] (stack your library), [[Sylvan Library]] (know what's coming), [[Darksteel Citadel]] (indestructible permanent if needed)
- **Potential Combos:** With library manipulation, this is essentially "Tap: Create a Gold token"
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - High variance, and the downside is real. Lose = sacrifice is brutal without rigging.
