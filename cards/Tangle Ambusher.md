## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Yeva, Nature's Herald]] flash enabler for green creatures; [[Vivien, Champion of the Wilds]] another flash enabler; [[Allosaurus Shepherd]] Elf tribal + uncounterable
- **Potential Combos:** [[Heroic Intervention]] this gives hexproof to one, that gives indestructible to all; [[Swiftfoot Boots]] permanent hexproof after this wears off; [[Destiny Spinner]] makes creatures uncounterable
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Flash creature with temporary hexproof is defensive but not broken. Good utility at common
