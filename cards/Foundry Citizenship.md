# Foundry Citizenship

## Card Type Line
Enchantment — Aura

## Rules Text
> Enchant creature you control
>
> When Foundry Citizenship enters the battlefield, put a +1/+1 counter on enchanted creature.
>
> Enchanted creature has vigilance, is a Mer-Ikan in addition to its other types, and can't be exiled by opponents.

## Flavor Text
> *"With this mark, the Furnace claims you. Without it, the Furnace consumes you."*

## Image Prompt
> A humanoid creature's arm being branded with a glowing golden seal shaped like the Great Furnace. The seal radiates protective light. In the background, other creatures without the brand are being led away by Reprocessing Agents. Warm gold and white tones contrasting with cold steel environment. MTG card art style, ceremonial yet bureaucratic atmosphere.

## Design Notes
- Provides protection from exile effects (can't be "deported")
- Grants the Mer-Ikan creature type
- **Counter synergy:** +1/+1 counter doubles with [[Hype Cycle]], can be Compounded
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - Represents legal status in the Foundry
- The vigilance represents "productive citizenship"

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Hardened Scales]] (extra +1/+1 counter), [[Ancestral Mask]] (aura stacking), [[Ethereal Armor]] (aura voltron), [[Sram, Senior Edificer]] (draw on cast)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Strong protection for 2 mana, but auras have inherent card disadvantage risk.
