# Foundry Citizenship

## Card Type Line
Enchantment — Aura

## Rules Text
> Enchant creature you control
>
> Enchanted creature gets +1/+1, has vigilance, and is a Mer-Ikan in addition to its other types.

## Flavor Text
> *"With this mark, the Furnace claims you. Without it, the Furnace consumes you."*

## Image Prompt
> Foundry Citizenship — Enchantment Aura. Visual focus: A humanoid creature's arm being branded with a glowing golden seal shaped like the Great Furnace, radiating protective light. Setting: The Great Furnace/Mer-Ikan Foundry — citizenship ceremony chamber. Mood: False promise. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Rebecca Guay. Color palette: Gold seal, white protective light, bronze arm, cold steel environment contrast.

## Design Notes
- Provides protection from exile effects (can't be "deported")
- Grants the Mer-Ikan creature type
- **Counter synergy:** +1/+1 counter doubles with [[Hype Cycle]], can be Compounded
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - Represents legal status in the Foundry
- The vigilance represents "productive citizenship"

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Hardened Scales]] (extra +1/+1 counter), [[Ancestral Mask]] (aura stacking), [[Ethereal Armor]] (aura voltron), [[Sram, Senior Edificer]] (draw on cast)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Strong protection for 2 mana, but auras have inherent card disadvantage risk.
