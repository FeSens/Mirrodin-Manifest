# Quantitative Destruction

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Each opponent creates X [[Debt Token|Debt tokens]], where X is the number of artifacts you control. Then redistribute among all Debt tokens.

## Flavor Text
> *"Print money. Spread the consequences."*

## Image Prompt
> Quantitative Destruction — Sorcery. Action depicted: A massive Izzet money-printing machine spewing debt contracts that spread like a plague across Mirrodin's landscape. Setting: En-Vidia Lattice processing facility, chrome pipes and glowing cyan conduits. Focal point: The machine's output chute where golden contracts transform into chains of debt. Mood: Reckless hubris, economic horror. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Seb McKinnon.

## Design Notes
- Izzet rare sorcery
- Rewards artifact-heavy builds
- Mass debt creation based on your artifacts
- Redistribution spreads the pain
- [[Lore]] connection: quantitative easing critique
- Pairs with: [[En-Vidia Processing Core]], [[Compute Debt]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Mycosynth Lattice]] (all permanents are artifacts = massive debt creation), [[Mechanized Production]] (copy artifacts to increase count), [[Smothering Tithe]] (more artifacts = more treasures = more debt for opponents), [[Academy Manufactor]] (triple your food/treasure/clue count)
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** With 10+ artifacts, each opponent gets 10+ Debt tokens. If Debt = lose 1 life per upkeep, this is 10+ damage per turn. In Affinity shell, easy to have 6+ artifacts creating devastating Debt loads
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN in artifact-heavy builds - The scaling with artifact count could get out of hand. Flag for clarity on rules text - what "redistribute among all Debt tokens" means mechanically needs clarification.
