# Quantitative Destruction

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Each opponent creates X Debt tokens, where X is the number of artifacts you control. *(A Debt token is an artifact that enters with two debt counters and "At the beginning of your upkeep, you lose 1 life, then remove a debt counter from this. When the last debt counter is removed, sacrifice it.")*

## Flavor Text
> *"Print money. Spread the consequences."*

## Image Prompt
> Quantitative Destruction — Sorcery. Action depicted: A massive Izzet money-printing machine spewing debt contracts that spread like a plague across Mirrodin's landscape. Setting: En-Vidia Lattice processing facility, chrome pipes and glowing cyan conduits. Focal point: The machine's output chute where golden contracts transform into chains of debt. Mood: Reckless hubris, economic horror. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Seb McKinnon.

## Design Notes
- Izzet rare sorcery
- Rewards artifact-heavy builds
- Mass debt creation based on your artifacts
- Redistribution spreads the pain
- [[Lore]] connection: quantitative easing critique
- Pairs with: [[En-Vidia Processing Core]], [[Compute Debt]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Mycosynth Lattice]] (all permanents are artifacts = massive debt creation), [[Mechanized Production]] (copy artifacts to increase count), [[Smothering Tithe]] (more artifacts = more treasures = more debt for opponents), [[Academy Manufactor]] (triple your food/treasure/clue count)
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** With 10+ artifacts, each opponent gets 10+ Debt tokens. If Debt = lose 1 life per upkeep, this is 10+ damage per turn. In Affinity shell, easy to have 6+ artifacts creating devastating Debt loads
- **Balance Assessment:** Strong in artifact-heavy builds. Fixed rules text to use proper Compound mechanic (each Debt token enters with 1 debt counter, then gets compounded to 2 debt counters = 2 life loss each). With 5 artifacts, each opponent takes 10 damage over their upkeep. Powerful but requires setup.
