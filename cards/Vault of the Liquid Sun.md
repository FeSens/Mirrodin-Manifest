## Image Prompt
> Vault of the Liquid Sun — Land. Time of day: Eternal golden glow from molten pools. Vantage point: Interior of vast underground vault, looking across gold pools. Key features: Pools of molten gold solidifying into ingots, Vedalken bankers cataloging wealth, worried investors watching flickering Lattice monitors above. Mood: False promise mixed with stability. Style reference: John Avon meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Warm gold, amber, anxious blue Lattice flickers.

## Design Notes
- Mana fixing for artifacts
- Creates Gold tokens (the gold rally)
- Slow but reliable value generation
- Enters tapped for balance
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Glimmervoid Rally (Gold Rally)]] - The Aurum Surge and Glimmervoid gold rally
- Safe haven for those who don't trust the Thought-Sync
- [[Gold Token]] synergy: Creates Gold for [[🎲 GAMBLE]] and [[COMPOUND]] strategies
- Pairs with: [[Hedge Fund Manager]], [[Quantitative Easer]], [[Gold Token]], [[The House Edge]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Clock of Omens]], artifact synergies
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Enters tapped with reasonable abilities
