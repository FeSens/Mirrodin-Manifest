# Burden Shift

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Redistribute among two target Debt tokens. *(Remove all counters from them, then each gets half that many counters, rounded down.)*
>
> Target opponent loses 2 life.

## Flavor Text
> *"Your debt becomes their debt. And they pay the price."*

## Image Prompt
> Burden Shift — Instant. Action depicted: A shadowy figure pulling red debt markers from one contract to another, life force draining visibly from a victim. Setting: Dross Dominion — a dim debt collection office. Focal point: Dark tendrils connecting debt tokens to suffering victim. Mood: Buried rage. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Seb McKinnon.

## Design Notes
