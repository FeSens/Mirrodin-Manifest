# Nim Patrol

## Card Type Line
Creature — Nim Zombie

## Rules Text
> Menace

## Flavor Text
> *"The Nim don't guard. They hunt."*

## Image Prompt
> Nim Patrol, Nim Zombie from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Dross Dominion — the fog-shrouded borders of Mephidross territory. Mood: Suspicion, relentless pursuit. Pose: Three Nim zombies moving in predatory unison, heads swiveling to scan for intruders. Key visual elements: Corroded chrome skeletons visible through decaying flesh, necrogen-green eyes piercing the mist, rusted weapons clutched in skeletal hands. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Near-black, dark olive, necrogen glow, rust browns.

## Design Notes
- Black 4-drop with menace
- Vanilla+ design for NWO compliance
- Zombie tribal support
- Pairs with: [[Nim Occupation Force]], [[Rusted Nim Conscript]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Zombie tribal ([[Lord of the Undead]], [[Undead Warchief]]) for standard zombie synergies, [[Gravecrawler]] recursion (works as a zombie for Gravecrawler casts)
- **Potential Combos:** None - vanilla creature
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - This is a simple common creature with no broken potential. Slightly below rate for limited (compare to [[Nessian Courser]] at 3/3 for 3).
