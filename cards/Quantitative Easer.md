## Image Prompt
> Quantitative Easer, Vedalken Wizard from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Seat of the Synod — chrome treasury chamber with gold token presses. Mood: False promise. Pose: Operating a massive gold-minting machine with practiced efficiency. Key visual elements: Chrome skull with exposed circuitry, dimming gold tokens piling high, metallic blue robes. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, fading gold.

## Design Notes
- Adds value counters to Gold (boosting assets)
- Creates Gold for everyone (money printing)
- Counter synergy: Value counters synergize with [[Hype Cycle]] and [[COMPOUND]]
- QE monetary policy reference
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Glimmervoid Rally (Gold Rally)]] - monetary policy
- Gold tokens synergize with [[🎲 GAMBLE]] rewards (Gamble creates Gold when you win)
- Pairs with: [[Inflation Harbinger]], [[Bailout Facilitator]], [[Market Crash]], [[Hedge Fund Manager]], [[Glimmervoid Broker]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Clock of Omens]] (untap to create more Gold), [[Inspiring Statuary]] (improvise with Gold tokens), [[Time Sieve]] (sacrifice 5 artifacts for extra turn, Gold are artifacts)
- **Potential Combos:** [[Intruder Alarm]] + token creation (each Gold token untaps creatures, but only if Gold are creatures - they're not)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - The symmetry of giving opponents Gold balances the effect. Value counters on Gold tokens seems flavorful but mechanically unclear (what do value counters do?). Needs rules clarification.
