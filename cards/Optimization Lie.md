# Optimization Lie

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Exile target creature. Its controller creates a 0/1 colorless Myr artifact creature token with "{T}: Add {C}."
>
> *"Your position has been automated."*

## Flavor Text
> *The Myr that replaced her couldn't do her job. But it was cheaper to maintain.*

## Image Prompt
> A worker being escorted out of a chrome forge by security Myr, their belongings in a small box. Behind them, a tiny, clearly inadequate Myr attempts to operate the complex machinery they just left—and fails, sparks flying. Management watches from above, unconcerned with the malfunction, only with the savings. Cold corporate lighting, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** "AI-washing" - companies blaming AI for layoffs when automation isn't actually ready
- **Lore:** The Optimization Lie across Mirrodin's forges
- The creature is exiled (fired) and "replaced" by a 0/1 Myr that only taps for mana
- The replacement is objectively worse—it can't attack, can't block meaningfully
- But it's an artifact that produces value, which is all management cares about
- Black for corporate cruelty and exploitation
- Pairs with: [[Displaced Worker]], [[Trough of Disillusionment]]
