# Optimization Lie

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Exile target creature. Its controller creates a 0/1 colorless Myr artifact creature token with "{T}: Add {C}."
>
> *"Your position has been automated."*

## Flavor Text
> *The Myr that replaced her couldn't do her job. But it was cheaper to maintain.*

## Image Prompt
> Optimization Lie — Sorcery. Action depicted: A worker with chrome-veined hands being escorted out by security Myr, belongings in a small box, while behind them a tiny, inadequate Myr fails catastrophically at their former station, sparks flying. Setting: En-Vidia processing facility, management observing from above. Focal point: The contrast between the exiled worker and the failing replacement. Mood: Institutional horror, false promise. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cold corporate white, sparks of failure.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** "AI-washing" - companies blaming AI for layoffs when automation isn't actually ready
- **Lore:** The Optimization Lie across Mirrodin's forges
- The creature is exiled (fired) and "replaced" by a 0/1 Myr that only taps for mana
- The replacement is objectively worse—it can't attack, can't block meaningfully
- But it's an artifact that produces value, which is all management cares about
- Black for corporate cruelty and exploitation
- Pairs with: [[Displaced Worker]], [[Trough of Disillusionment]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Swords to Plowshares]] / [[Path to Exile]] (comparison: gives opponent mana rock instead of life/land), [[Opposition Agent]] (if you control their searching, you could theoretically leverage the mana rock)
- **Potential Combos:** With [[Harmless Offering]] + [[Hushbringer]] effects: give opponent creatures that won't give them tokens. [[Fractured Identity]] is similar space of giving opponents things
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - At 3 mana sorcery speed, this is slightly worse than [[Rapid Hybridization]] (1 mana instant, gives 3/3) or [[Pongify]]. The "downside" of giving a mana dork is actually a real downside. Balanced.
