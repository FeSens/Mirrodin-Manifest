## Image Prompt
> Kha-Sino, Fortune's Dealer, Legendary Cat Rogue from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Glimmervoid — a floating casino platform suspended above the golden plains. Mood: Corrupted triumph, false promise. Pose: Standing behind a dealer's table, claws spread in welcome, tail curled with calculated grace. Key visual elements: Magnificent Leonin with chrome-tipped mane and gold-inlaid fur patterns, spectral dice orbiting their head, gold tokens materializing from thin air, eyes that see every probability. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: Gold, white, bright chrome, Gruul red-green accents in attire.

## Design Notes
- Gruul Mythic - addresses Red mythic gap (-3) and Green mythic gap (-3)
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] lord - the ultimate gamble enabler
- Scry before all gambles = massive advantage (like [[The House Edge]] built in)
- Creates economy loop with Gold tokens
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Glimmervoid Rally (Gold Rally)]] - The dealer behind the tables
- Pairs with: [[The House Edge]], [[Glimmervoid Broker]], [[Hedge Fund Manager]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Krark's Thumb]] combined with built-in scry means you'll almost always win gambles; [[Chance Encounter]] end step gamble adds luck counters automatically; [[Smothering Tithe]]/[[Revel in Riches]] Gold token synergies
- **Potential Combos:** [[Clock of Omens]] + Gold tokens - sacrifice triggers more gambles, untap artifacts; [[Strionic Resonator]] copy the end step gamble trigger for more Gold generation; [[Goldspan Dragon]] Gold tokens tap for extra mana
- **Balance Assessment:** Very powerful as the "gamble lord" - scry before all gambles is like having Krark's Thumb built-in. Strong in Commander but balanced by 4 mana cost
