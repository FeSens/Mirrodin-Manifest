# The Rigged Game

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Scry 2, then gamble.
>
> If you win the gamble, compound twice. *(Choose a permanent with a counter on it and add a counter of that type to it, twice.)*
>
> If you lose the gamble, redistribute. *(Choose two permanents with counters. Remove all counters from them, then each gets half that many counters, rounded down.)*

## Flavor Text
> *Win, and the wealth compounds. Lose, and everyone shares the pain. Either way, you're never the one who suffers.*

## Image Prompt
> The Rigged Game — Sorcery. Action depicted: A player secretly manipulating a gambling table from above while opponents remain oblivious. Setting: Glimmervoid back room — intimate private gambling den. Focal point: Mirror beneath table showing opponent's deck, cheater's serene confident smile, probability calculations reflected in chrome. Mood: False promise. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Dim gold lighting, shadow black, chrome reflections.

## Design Notes
- **Mechanic:** Touches all three set mechanics — Scry (gamble support), Gamble, Compound, Redistribute
- **The Rigged Game:** Scry 2 lets you stack the deck in your favor before gambling
- WIN: You compound twice — exponential growth as reward for your "skill"
- LOSE: You redistribute — if you somehow still lose, tear down the winner's advantage
- Either outcome benefits you or hurts your opponent; there's no clean loss
- Mono-blue because it's pure manipulation without the predatory black edge
- Cheaper than Market Manipulation (3 vs 4 mana) but less explosive
- **Philosophy:** The powerful never truly lose — they just change the rules
- Pairs with: [[The House Edge]], [[Market Manipulation]], [[🎲 GAMBLE]], [[COMPOUND]], [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** The House Edge (guaranteed win), Proliferate (compound counters)
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** With The House Edge, this is Scry 2, then scry 1, then guaranteed compound twice - exponential counter growth
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Requires synergy cards to maximize
