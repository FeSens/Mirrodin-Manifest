# Loan Shark

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Rogue

## Rules Text
> Whenever Loan Shark deals combat damage to a player, that player creates a [[Debt Token|Debt token]].
>
> *(Debt tokens enter with a debt counter. At your upkeep, lose life equal to its debt counters, then sacrifice it.)*

## Flavor Text
> *"The first payment is always free."*

## Image Prompt
> A sleek, predatory human in dark chrome armor lurking in the shadows of the Furnace district. Sharp teeth visible in a calculating smile, holding a contract scroll that glows with red runes. Gold coins and debt markers float around them. Noir aesthetic, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- Black common creature
- Primary debt-creation at common
- Aggressive 2/1 body punishes unblocked attacks
- Creates [[Debt Token]] on combat damage
- Pairs with: [[Collection Agent]], [[Compound Interest]], [[Predatory Lending]]
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] synergy: creates targets for redistribution
