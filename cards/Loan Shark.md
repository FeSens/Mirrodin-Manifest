# Loan Shark

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Rogue

## Rules Text
> Whenever Loan Shark deals combat damage to a player, that player creates a [[Debt Token|Debt token]].
>
> *(Debt tokens enter with a debt counter. At your upkeep, lose life equal to its debt counters, then sacrifice it.)*

## Flavor Text
> *"The first payment is always free."*

## Image Prompt
> Loan Shark, Human Rogue from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Dross Dominion — lurking in the shadows of the Furnace district's debtor quarter. Mood: Corrupted triumph, predatory patience. Pose: Leaning against a wall, one hand holding a contract scroll that glows with debt-runes, calculating smile revealing sharp chrome-capped teeth. Key visual elements: Dark chrome armor with predatory styling, iron-veined skin, Debt tokens manifesting around potential victims, gold coins and markers floating in orbit. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Near-black, dark olive, debt-red runes, gold glints.

## Design Notes
- Black common creature
- Primary debt-creation at common
- Aggressive 2/1 body punishes unblocked attacks
- Creates [[Debt Token]] on combat damage
- Pairs with: [[Collection Agent]], [[Compound Interest]], [[Predatory Lending]]
- [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] synergy: creates targets for redistribution

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Curse of Stalked Prey]] / Equipment (pump to ensure damage), [[Whispersilk Cloak]] (unblockable debt creation), [[Tainted Strike]] (extra pressure with infect)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Combat damage trigger on a 2/1 for 2 is reasonable. Debt tokens appear to be 1 damage then sacrifice.
