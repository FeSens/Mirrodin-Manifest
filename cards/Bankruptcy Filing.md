# Bankruptcy Filing

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Destroy all [[Debt Token|Debt tokens]] you control. You can't create Debt tokens until end of turn.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Tangle knows no currency."*

## Image Prompt
> Bankruptcy Filing — Sorcery. Action depicted: A figure casting debt contracts into a ritual bonfire, copper-leafed trees bending toward the flames approvingly. Setting: The Tangle — a sacred clearing where nature reclaims. Focal point: Debt tokens dissolving into ash and forest light. Mood: Genuine hope. Style reference: Rebecca Guay meets John Avon.

## Design Notes
- Green common sorcery
- Self-debt removal at just {G}
- Downside: can't create Debt this turn (prevents abuse with debt-for-benefit cards)
- Green's philosophy: reject the debt system entirely
- Addresses Green common gap
- Pairs with: [[Natural Economy]], [[Inflation Hedge]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Self-debt removal card
- **Potential Combos:** None
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Narrow application, requires Debt token infrastructure.
