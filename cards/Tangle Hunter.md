# Tangle Hunter

## Card Type Line
Creature — Elf Warrior

## Rules Text
> Reach
>
> When Tangle Hunter enters the battlefield, you may destroy target artifact.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Tangle remembers what was taken."*

## Image Prompt
> Tangle Hunter, Elf Warrior from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Tangle — canopy of copper leaves with surveillance drones above. Mood: Grim determination. Pose: Emerging from vines, bow drawn skyward. Key visual elements: Chrome-bone bow, iron-veined arms, Foundry drone in crosshairs above. Style reference: Kev Walker meets Rebecca Guay. Color palette: Copper, forest green, steel blue drone.

## Design Notes
- Green uncommon creature - ETB artifact destruction is too strong for common
- Reach plus artifact removal for Mirrodin flavor
- Green's artifact hate at common
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Tangle Resistance]]
- Pairs with: [[Resistance Saboteur]], [[Opposition Leader]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Panharmonicon]] doubles ETB destroys two artifacts; [[Yarok, the Desecrated]] triples ETB in Sultai; [[Conjurer's Closet]] repeated artifact destruction
- **Potential Combos:** [[Cloudstone Curio]] bounce and replay for repeated triggers; [[Deadeye Navigator]] infinite blinks = destroy all artifacts; [[Restoration Angel]] instant-speed artifact removal
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - ETB artifact destruction is strong but balanced by being optional ("may destroy"). Reach is nice utility
