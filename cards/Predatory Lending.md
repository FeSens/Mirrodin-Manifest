# Predatory Lending

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Target opponent creates a [[Debt Token|Debt token]]. You gain 2 life.

## Flavor Text
> *"Sign here. Don't read the fine print."*

## Image Prompt
> Predatory Lending — Instant. Action depicted: A shadowy figure with chrome fingernails extending a blood-red glowing contract toward a desperate victim, gold already flowing from the victim's pockets toward the predator. Setting: A dim alley in the Dross Dominion financial district. Focal point: The pulsing contract and the one-directional flow of wealth. Mood: Corrupted triumph, false promise. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Greg Staples. Color palette: Near-black, dark olive, blood-red contract glow, gold flowing away.

## Design Notes
- Black common instant
- Cheap debt creation at {B}
- Life swing: opponent will lose 1, you gain 2 = 3 life differential
- Enables aggressive debt strategies
- Pairs with: [[Loan Shark]], [[Collection Agent]], [[Master of Debt]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Tainted Remedy]] (if debt tokens cause life gain when sacrificed, this reverses it), [[Wound Reflection]] (doubles the life loss from debt), [[Ob Nixilis, Unshackled]] (punishes opponent)
- **Potential Combos:** Mass debt + [[Bloodchief Ascension]] (every debt payment triggers Ascension). With [[Painful Quandary]] style effects to compound the punishment
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - 1 mana for 3 life differential (assuming debt = lose 1 life) is reasonable. Compares to cards like Chaplain's Blessing but requires setup.
