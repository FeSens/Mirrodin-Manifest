# Processing Myr

## Card Type Line
Artifact Creature — Myr

## Rules Text
> When Processing Myr enters the battlefield, draw a card, then discard a card.

## Flavor Text
> *"Input. Process. Output. Repeat."*

## Image Prompt
> Processing Myr, Myr from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: En-Vidia Lattice — a data processing hub filled with chrome terminals. Mood: Institutional efficiency. Pose: Standing upright, arms extended, data streams visibly flowing through transparent chest components as it sorts and filters information. Key visual elements: Larger than standard Myr, translucent torso showing blue data currents, multiple optical sensors. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Stephan Martiniere. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan data streams, cold processing light.

## Design Notes
- Colorless common artifact creature - addresses Colorless common gap (-6)
- Card filtering for any deck
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]]
- Pairs with: [[En-Vidia Processing Core]], [[Deep-Sik Efficiency]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Panharmonicon]] (double loot), [[Emry, Lurker of the Loch]] (can recast from graveyard), [[Teshar, Ancestor's Apostle]] (historic trigger for recursion), [[Goblin Welder]] (swap artifacts for repeated looting)
- **Potential Combos:** [[Emry, Lurker of the Loch]] + [[Mirran Spy]] + cost reducers (if you can make this free, infinite looting). [[Nim Deathmantle]] + [[Ashnod's Altar]] (standard artifact recursion loop)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - 4 mana for a 3/3 looter is below rate. Compare to Merchant of the Vale (3 mana 2/3) or similar. The artifact typing enables combos but nothing unique to this card.
