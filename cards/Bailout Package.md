# Bailout Package

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Destroy target artifact. Its controller creates two [[Debt Token|Debt tokens]].

## Flavor Text
> *"The Foundry saves you—but the Foundry never forgets."*

## Image Prompt
> Bailout Package — Sorcery. Action depicted: A massive chrome hand descending from clouds to lift a crumbling forge, debt chains wrapping around the structure as it rises. Setting: Mer-Ikan Foundry industrial district, bureaucrats observing from below. Focal point: The intersection of salvation and bondage where chains meet chrome. Mood: False promise. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Greg Staples.

## Design Notes
- White uncommon sorcery
- Artifact removal with debt creation rider
- "Help" that comes with strings attached
- Flavorful: bailouts create debt
- [[Lore]] connection: government intervention themes
- Pairs with: [[Central Bank Governor]], [[Debt Restructuring]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Self-targeting artifacts for Debt tokens if you want them, Debt synergy cards from this set
- **Potential Combos:** None
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Standard removal with set-specific rider. Well-costed.
