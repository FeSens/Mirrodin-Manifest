## Flavor Text
> *"Progress is dangerous. Stability is paramount."*

## Image Prompt
> Synod High Chancellor, Vedalken Advisor from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Seat of the Synod throne room — ancient chrome chair, dust visible on every surface. Mood: Institutional horror. Pose: Seated absolutely still in grand chair, four hands folded in deliberate inaction, eyes watching everything change nothing. Key visual elements: Heavy ceremonial robes weighted with tradition, stagnation counters forming like frost around the throne, dust motes frozen in air around the motionless figure. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, stagnant grey, white robes yellowed with age.

## Design Notes
- Represents establishment politicians who resist change
- Stagnation counters build when nothing happens
- Hexproof from inaction, power from paralysis
- Anti-synergy with counter-heavy strategies - counters [[COMPOUND]] and [[Hype Cycle]]
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - establishment Synod leadership
- Pairs with: [[Mak-Ron, the Glass Orator]], [[Glimmervoid Lobbyist]], [[Austerity Minister]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Solemnity]] (prevents stagnation counters - anti-synergy, never gets hexproof), [[The Ozolith]] (stores stagnation counters), [[Karn's Bastion]] (proliferate stagnation counters faster), Stax strategies (rewards doing nothing)
- **Potential Combos:** Synod High Chancellor + [[Clockspinning]]/Proliferate (accelerate to 5 counters for repeated Edict effects)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - The "no counters placed" condition is restrictive. In most games, counters are placed frequently. The payoff is slow (5 turns of nothing to activate). More of a stax piece than a combo enabler.
