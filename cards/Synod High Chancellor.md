# Synod High Chancellor

## Card Type Line
Legendary Creature — Vedalken Advisor

## Rules Text
> At the beginning of each end step, if no counters were put on permanents this turn, put a stagnation counter on Synod High Chancellor.
>
> Synod High Chancellor has hexproof as long as it has three or more stagnation counters on it.
>
> {T}, Remove five stagnation counters from Synod High Chancellor: Each opponent sacrifices a creature.

## Flavor Text
> *"Progress is dangerous. Stability is paramount."*

## Image Prompt
> An ancient Vedalken in heavy ceremonial robes, seated in a grand chair at the Seat of the Synod. Nothing moves. Nothing changes. Everything stagnates by design.

## Design Notes
- Represents establishment politicians who resist change
- Stagnation counters build when nothing happens
- Hexproof from inaction, power from paralysis
- Anti-synergy with counter-heavy strategies - counters [[COMPOUND]] and [[Hype Cycle]]
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - establishment Synod leadership
- Pairs with: [[Mak-Ron, the Glass Orator]], [[Glimmervoid Lobbyist]], [[Austerity Minister]]
