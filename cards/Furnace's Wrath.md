# Furnace's Wrath

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> If an instant or sorcery spell you control would deal damage to a permanent or player, it deals that much damage plus 1 instead.
>
> Whenever you win a gamble, Furnace's Wrath deals 2 damage to each opponent.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Great Furnace remembers every slight."*

## Image Prompt
> Furnace's Wrath — Enchantment. Visual focus: The Great Furnace erupting with molten fury, bolts of liquid metal striking targets across the battlefield — every burn spell amplified by the Furnace's rage. Setting: The Great Furnace/Oxidda — battlefield beneath the erupting Furnace. Mood: Buried rage. Style reference: Seb McKinnon meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Furnace orange eruption, copper bolts, bronze battlefield, dark red sky.

## Design Notes
- **Burn spell hub** - makes all damage spells better
- Connects: [[Furnace Bolt]], [[Foundry Flames]], [[Gambler's Instinct]], [[Lucky Strike]], [[Flames of Fortune]], [[Volatile Reaction]]
- Gamble trigger connects to [[Fortune's Favor]], [[All-In Gambler]], [[The House Edge]]
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]]
- Pairs with: [[Furnace Populist]], [[Foundry Apprentice]], [[Pyromantic Gambit]]
- Red aggro payoff enchantment

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Fiery Confluence]] (extra damage on all modes), [[Chain Lightning]] (improved efficiency), [[Guttersnipe]] (burn triggers + bonus damage), [[Thermo-Alchemist]] (repeatable ping now deals 2)
- **Potential Combos:** With "each target" wording, multi-target spells get significant boosts ([[Searing Blaze]] becomes 4/4 instead of 3/3)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Similar to Pyromancer's Gauntlet but cheaper with a smaller bonus. Gamble trigger is set-specific.
