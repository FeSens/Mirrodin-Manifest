# Private Isle Guard

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Soldier

## Rules Text
> Private Isle Guard can't block Unforged creatures.
>
> When Private Isle Guard dies, each player reveals their hand.

## Flavor Text
> *"I saw nothing. I heard nothing. I know... everything."*

## Image Prompt
> An armored guard standing at a gate on the Private Isle, eyes averted from what's happening inside. Their expression is haunted, complicit. They wear no insignia. Deniable loyalty.

## Design Notes
- Can't block Unforged (can't stop victims)
- Death reveals hands (their secrets die with them)
- Common for the Ep-Styn guard force
- Complicit but aware
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Great Ep-Styn Mystery]] - guards on the Private Isle
- Pairs with: [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]], [[The Black Ledger]], [[Veiled Client]]
