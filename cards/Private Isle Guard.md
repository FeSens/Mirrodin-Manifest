# Private Isle Guard

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Soldier

## Rules Text

## Flavor Text
> *"I saw nothing. I heard nothing. I know... everything."*

## Image Prompt
> Private Isle Guard, Human Soldier from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Dross Dominion — a gate to a private isle, forbidden things happening beyond. Mood: Suspicion, complicity. Pose: Standing rigid at attention, chrome-inlaid armor bearing no insignia, eyes deliberately averted from what passes through the gate. Key visual elements: Haunted expression, iron-veined skin beneath helmet, deliberately empty hands. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Near-black, dark olive, cold chrome, shadows hiding secrets.

## Design Notes
- Can't block Unforged (can't stop victims)
- Death reveals hands (their secrets die with them)
- Common for the Ep-Styn guard force
- Complicit but aware
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Great Ep-Styn Mystery]] - guards on the Private Isle
- Pairs with: [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]], [[The Black Ledger]], [[Veiled Client]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Telepathy]] (already know hands, but this adds redundancy), [[Vendilion Clique]] (information + disruption), [[Thought Erasure]] effects (use revealed info for discard), [[Gitaxian Probe]] (banned, similar information effect)
- **Potential Combos:** With sacrifice outlets + reanimation: repeated Telepathy effects. [[Shirei, Shizo's Caretaker]] (keeps bringing back 1-power creatures) doesn't apply as this is 3 power
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - The reveal is symmetric and requires the creature to die. The "can't block Unforged" is a set-specific downside. 3/2 for 3 with downsides is reasonable.
