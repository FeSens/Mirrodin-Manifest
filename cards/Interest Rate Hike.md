# Interest Rate Hike

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Put two debt counters on each Debt token.

## Flavor Text
> *"Adjustment effective immediately."*

## Image Prompt
> Interest Rate Hike — Instant. Action depicted: A Foundry official in red robes slamming a chrome gavel, shockwaves rippling outward as Debt tokens across the scene pulse brighter, their debt counters visibly multiplying while debtors clutch their heads in anguish. Setting: The Mer-Ikan Foundry, an economic tribunal chamber. Focal point: The gavel's impact, the rippling consequence. Mood: Institutional horror, buried rage. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Furnace orange, dark red robes, bronze, glowing debt-light.

## Design Notes
- Red uncommon instant
- Mass debt increase: every Debt now deals +2 damage
- Devastating when multiple Debts are in play (3 Debts = +6 total damage)
- Red's chaotic, destructive economics
- Cross-format: Works with ANY Debt tokens in any format
- Pairs with: [[Compound Interest]], [[Default Cascade]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Cards that create Debt tokens for opponents (amplify punishment), Mass Debt creation like Infrastructure Collapse (follow up for lethal)
- **Potential Combos:** If Debt tokens deal damage equal to debt counters, mass Debt + this = massive damage spike
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Requires Debt tokens to exist. Set-specific amplifier.
