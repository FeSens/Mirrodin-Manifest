# Interest Rate Hike

## Card Type Line
Instant

## Rules Text
> Put two debt counters on each [[Debt Token|Debt token]].

## Flavor Text
> *"Adjustment effective immediately."*

## Image Prompt
> A red-robed official slamming down a gavel, causing all debt contracts across the land to glow brighter and grow heavier. Debtors cry out as their burdens suddenly double. Economic chaos, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- Red uncommon instant
- Mass debt increase: every Debt now deals +2 damage
- Devastating when multiple Debts are in play (3 Debts = +6 total damage)
- Red's chaotic, destructive economics
- Cross-format: Works with ANY Debt tokens in any format
- Pairs with: [[Compound Interest]], [[Default Cascade]]
