# Free Market Zealot

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Advisor

## Rules Text
> Whenever a player compounds, you create a Gold token. *(It's an artifact that enters with a value counter. It has "Sacrifice this artifact: Add {C} for each value counter on it.")*
>
> Whenever a player redistributes, sacrifice a permanent you control.

## Flavor Text
> *"Growth is sacred. Redistribution is theft."*

## Image Prompt
> Free Market Zealot, Human Advisor from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Glimmervoid financial district — trading floor with holographic charts. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Pose: Gesturing intensely at rising charts, gold coins flowing upward around them. Key visual elements: Iron-veined face with zealous conviction, gold coins ascending around figure, workers toiling in background shadows. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Gold coins, white charts, bronze skin, dark worker shadows.

## Design Notes
- Rewards [[COMPOUND]] (capital gains)
- Punishes [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] (anti-socialism)
- Gold tokens for economic theme
- Core mechanic interaction - embodies the mechanical triangle
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Glimmervoid Rally (Gold Rally)]] - free market ideology
- Gold from Compound synergizes with [[🎲 GAMBLE]] (more Gold to gamble with)
- Pairs with: [[Trickle-Down Theorist]], [[Hedge Fund Manager]], [[Austerity Minister]], [[Glimmervoid Broker]], [[The Rigged Game]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Smothering Tithe]] (if Compound is common, massive Gold generation), [[Goldspan Dragon]] (Gold/Treasure synergy), [[Anointed Procession]] (double Gold tokens)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Requires set-specific mechanics to evaluate fully. Design is interesting risk/reward.
