# Free Market Zealot

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Advisor

## Rules Text
> Whenever a player compounds, you create a Gold token. *(It's an artifact that enters with a value counter. It has "Sacrifice this artifact: Add {C} for each value counter on it.")*
>
> Whenever a player redistributes, sacrifice a permanent you control.

## Flavor Text
> *"Growth is sacred. Redistribution is theft."*

## Image Prompt
> An intense human economist gesturing at rising charts, gold coins flowing upward around them. Behind them, workers toil. Pure ideology.

## Design Notes
- Rewards [[COMPOUND]] (capital gains)
- Punishes [[☭REDISTRIBUTE]] (anti-socialism)
- Gold tokens for economic theme
- Core mechanic interaction - embodies the mechanical triangle
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Glimmervoid Rally (Gold Rally)]] - free market ideology
- Gold from Compound synergizes with [[🎲 GAMBLE]] (more Gold to gamble with)
- Pairs with: [[Trickle-Down Theorist]], [[Hedge Fund Manager]], [[Austerity Minister]], [[Glimmervoid Broker]], [[The Rigged Game]]
