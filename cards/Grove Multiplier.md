## Image Prompt
> Grove Multiplier, Elf Shaman from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Tangle — a clearing where copper trees bow toward a ritual circle. Mood: Genuine hope, primal power. Pose: Arms raised, channeling spiraling green and copper energy into a creature whose muscles bulge and expand. Key visual elements: Metallic hair woven with leaves, chrome bones visible through translucent skin, the target creature's +1/+1 counters manifesting as crystalline growths. Style reference: Rebecca Guay. Color palette: Copper, forest green, olive, bright growth-light.

## Design Notes
- Green uncommon counter synergy
- Compound mechanic payoff
- Powerful with +1/+1 counter strategies
- Pairs with: [[COMPOUND]], [[Fortune's Gardener]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Hydras ([[Primordial Hydra]], [[Kalonian Hydra]] - doubling already-doubling creatures), [[Pir, Imaginative Rascal]] (counter synergy), [[Corpsejack Menace]] (counter doubling stacks), [[Walking Ballista]] (double counters for more damage)
- **Potential Combos:** [[Walking Ballista]] (20 counters) + Grove Multiplier + [[Panharmonicon]] = Quadruple counters = massive damage
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - One-shot [[Doubling Season]] for creatures. Strong but requires setup. Compare to [[Kalonian Hydra]] which does this every attack.
