## Image Prompt
> Zel-Ensk, the Resilient Spark, Legendary Leonin Soldier from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Fortified watchtower — last line of defense against aggression. Mood: Genuine hope. Pose: Standing defiantly, resistance counters glowing, equipment-laden and ready. Key visual elements: Battle-scarred chrome-maned Leonin, practical armor adorned with equipment, loyal soldiers rallying behind, Vault of Whispers burning distantly. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Kev Walker. Color palette: White and gold armor, forest green accents, copper equipment, distant fire.

## Design Notes
- Zel-Ensk from [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - Zelensky allegory
- Indestructible = resilience
- Counter synergy: Resistance counters create soldiers, [[Hype Cycle]] doubles, [[COMPOUND]] adds
- Equipment synergy references his famous quote
- Pairs with: [[Put-In, the Iron Despot]], [[Watchtower Defender]], [[Foreign Arms Supplier]], [[Civilian Militia]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Puresteel Paladin]] free equips stack with cost reduction, [[Hammer of Nazahn]] equipment enter attached, Sword cycle for protection/value
- **Balance Assessment:** Changed from free equip to {2} cost reduction to prevent broken combos with [[Colossus Hammer]] (still costs {6} instead of {8}) and [[Worldslayer]] (still costs {3} instead of {5}). Mythic-appropriate power level that rewards equipment synergies without enabling degenerate one-shot kills.
