## Design Notes
- **Artifact sacrifice hub** - connects artifact synergy cards
- Connects: [[Foundry Apprentice]], [[Scrapheap Raider]], [[Gold Token]], [[Hedge]], [[Myr Replicant]]
- Sacrifice outlet with multiple rewards
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]]
- Pairs with: [[Gold Rush Frenzy]], [[Myr Fabrication Protocol]], [[The Myr Collective]]
- Creates artifact sacrifice archetype

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Works with artifact token generators like Treasure, Clue, or Food tokens; [[Marionette Master]], [[Disciple of the Vault]], and [[Reckless Fireweaver]] for stacking sacrifice damage
- **POTENTIALLY BROKEN Combos:** [[Pitiless Plunderer]] + any artifact creature + free sacrifice outlet = infinite damage/life; [[Dross Scorpion]] + [[Myr Turbine]] = infinite tokens and damage; [[Krark-Clan Ironworks]] + recursive artifacts = unbounded damage
- **Balance Assessment:** POTENTIALLY BROKEN - "Whenever you sacrifice an artifact" with no "once per turn" clause enables infinite combos with artifact recursion engines. Consider adding "once per turn" to the damage/life trigger
