## Image Prompt
> Scrap Salvager, Goblin Artificer from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Oxidda scrapyard — mountains of broken artifacts and furnace glow. Mood: Buried rage turned to glee. Pose: Surrounded by scrap, one hand converting debris into a weapon, the other hurling salvaged metal. Key visual elements: Iron-reinforced ears, copper-veined grin, chrome teeth, sparks flying from makeshift forge strapped to back. Style reference: Kev Walker. Color palette: Furnace orange, copper, rust red.

## Design Notes
- **Artifact sacrifice hub** - connects artifact synergy cards
- Connects: [[Foundry Apprentice]], [[Scrapheap Raider]], [[Gold Token]], [[Hedge]], [[Myr Replicant]]
- Sacrifice outlet with multiple rewards
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Mer-Ikan Foundry (America)]]
- Pairs with: [[Gold Rush Frenzy]], [[Myr Fabrication Protocol]], [[The Myr Collective]]
- Creates artifact sacrifice archetype

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Works with artifact token generators like Treasure, Clue, or Food tokens; [[Marionette Master]], [[Disciple of the Vault]], and [[Reckless Fireweaver]] for stacking sacrifice damage
- **POTENTIALLY BROKEN Combos:** [[Pitiless Plunderer]] + any artifact creature + free sacrifice outlet = infinite damage/life; [[Dross Scorpion]] + [[Myr Turbine]] = infinite tokens and damage; [[Krark-Clan Ironworks]] + recursive artifacts = unbounded damage
- **Balance Assessment:** FIXED - Added "This ability triggers only once each turn" to prevent infinite combos with artifact recursion engines.
