# Opposition Leader

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Advisor

## Rules Text
> Whenever an opponent activates an ability of a legendary permanent, put a resistance counter on Opposition Leader.
>

## Flavor Text
> *"Every decree they issue strengthens our cause."*

## Image Prompt
> Opposition Leader, Human Advisor from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: A crowded plaza between the Foundry and Lattice districts — towers of power looming in the distance. Mood: Buried rage, defiance. Pose: Standing elevated before a gathered crowd, fist raised against the distant chrome spires, face lit by torch fire. Key visual elements: Chrome-threaded hair, resistance symbols sewn into weathered blue-and-red clothing, metallic veins visible on raised forearm. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Steel blue, copper-red, crowd warmth against cold distant chrome.

## Design Notes
- Tracks opponent's legendary abilities (opposition research)
- Counter synergy: Resistance counters fuel ability countering, [[Hype Cycle]] doubles, [[COMPOUND]] adds
- Sanctioning mechanic = countering abilities
- Izzet politics/opposition archetype
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - political opposition
- Pairs with: [[Zel-Ensk, the Resilient Spark]], [[Mak-Ron, the Glass Orator]], [[Synod High Chancellor]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Sisay, Weatherlight Captain]] (opponent activating Sisay feeds you counters), [[Urza, Lord High Artificer]] (repeated legendary activations give counters), [[The Ozolith]] (can store resistance counters if Opposition Leader dies), [[Vorel of the Hull Clade]] (double resistance counters)
- **Potential Combos:** Against [[Thrasios, Triton Hero]]/[[Tymna the Weaver]] decks: feeds off their commander activations. With [[Clock of Omens]] + artifact copies: untap repeatedly for multiple counter abilities
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Requires opponent cooperation (using legendary abilities), costs mana and counters to activate, only counters activated abilities. Narrow but flavorful hate piece.
