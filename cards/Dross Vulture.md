## Image Prompt
> Dross Vulture, Zombie Bird from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Vault of Whispers/Dross Dominion — circling above Mephidross swamps. Mood: Suspicion. Pose: Wings spread in lazy circle, dripping black ichor, watching below with dead patience. Key visual elements: Chrome skeleton visible through rotting feathers, ichor trailing from wings, necrogen-lit eyes. Style reference: Nils Hamm. Color palette: Near-black body, dark olive ichor, faint necrogen eye glow.

## Design Notes
- Black common flyer with drain effect
- Simple death trigger for NWO compliance
- Aggressive evasion for black strategies
- Pairs with: [[Mephidross Refugee]], [[Dross Harvester]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Rally the Ancestors]] (mass reanimation for drain effects), [[Skullclamp]] (draw and drain), [[Teysa Karlov]] (doubles death trigger), [[Bloodghast]] (similar recursive pressure cards)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Appropriate power level for a common. Well-designed Limited card.
