## Flavor Text
> *The breakthrough was always imminent. The deadline was always moving.*

## Image Prompt
> Sal-Tman's Promise — Enchantment. Visual focus: A massive chrome progress bar projected above a boardroom, stuck at 97% with years of dust gathered on the display. Setting: Seat of the Synod corporate chamber, Vedalken with chrome skulls seated around a darksteel table. Mood: False promise. Key visual elements: Progress counters orbiting the frozen projection, exhausted and hopeful investors mixed together, Sal-Tman gesturing enthusiastically at nothing. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, corporate white.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Sam Altman's perpetual AGI predictions that never materialize on schedule
- **Lore:** The Thought-Sync's promise of true machine sentience
- Progress counters build up, providing scry value (useful predictions)
- But when it "completes," you draw a lot then discard everything—the promise delivers, but not what you expected
- The 5-counter threshold represents the perpetually moving goalpost
- Synergy with [[Compound]] to accelerate the "progress" (and the crash)
- [[Hype Cycle]] doubles progress counters—faster promise, faster disappointment
- Pairs with: [[Sal-Tman, Prophet of the Core-Logic]], [[Trough of Disillusionment]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Proliferate effects (accelerate progress counters to 5), [[Doubling Season]] (enters with 2 counters, accelerates draw), [[Necropotence]] / [[Notion Thief]] (synergy after the big draw), [[Library of Leng]] (discard to top of library instead of graveyard)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - The discard clause prevents this from being broken card advantage. It's actually card-neutral or negative depending on hand size.
