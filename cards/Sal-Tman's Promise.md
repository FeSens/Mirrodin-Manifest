# Sal-Tman's Promise

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> At the beginning of your upkeep, put a progress counter on Sal-Tman's Promise.
>
> {T} an untapped artifact you control: Scry 1.
>
> When Sal-Tman's Promise has five or more progress counters on it, sacrifice it. If you do, draw cards equal to the number of progress counters on it, then discard your hand.
>
> *"We're so close. Just a little more investment."*

## Flavor Text
> *The breakthrough was always imminent. The deadline was always moving.*

## Image Prompt
> A massive progress bar projected in chrome light above a Vedalken boardroom—it shows 97% complete, but a closer look reveals it's been at 97% for years. Dust has gathered on the display. Investors sit around a table, some hopeful, some exhausted. Sal-Tman stands at the head, gesturing enthusiastically at the frozen progress. Blue and white corporate aesthetic, the feeling of perpetual almost-there, MTG card art style.

## Design Notes
- **Source:** Sam Altman's perpetual AGI predictions that never materialize on schedule
- **Lore:** The Thought-Sync's promise of true machine sentience
- Progress counters build up, providing scry value (useful predictions)
- But when it "completes," you draw a lot then discard everything—the promise delivers, but not what you expected
- The 5-counter threshold represents the perpetually moving goalpost
- Synergy with [[Compound]] to accelerate the "progress" (and the crash)
- [[Hype Cycle]] doubles progress counters—faster promise, faster disappointment
- Pairs with: [[Sal-Tman, Prophet of the Core-Logic]], [[Trough of Disillusionment]]
