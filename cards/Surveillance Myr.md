# Surveillance Myr

## Card Type Line
Artifact Creature — Myr

## Rules Text
> When Surveillance Myr enters the battlefield, scry 1.

## Flavor Text
> *"Every movement logged. Every face catalogued."*

## Image Prompt
> Surveillance Myr, Myr from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: En-Vidia Lattice observation corridor — data streams visible in the air. Mood: Institutional horror. Pose: Hovering silently at corner height, single massive eye tracking all movement below. Key visual elements: Chrome body optimized for stealth, oversized optical sensor glowing cyan, data being recorded as visible streams flowing into its core. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, cyan eye glow.

## Design Notes
- Colorless common artifact creature - addresses Colorless common gap (-6)
- Scry synergizes with [[🎲 GAMBLE]]
- NWO-compliant simple design
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]]
- Pairs with: [[Data Collector]], [[Data Harvest Drone]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Myr Battlesphere]] (Myr tribal), [[Urza, Lord High Artificer]] (tap for mana), [[Teshar, Ancestor's Apostle]] (historic trigger), [[Emry, Lurker of the Loch]] (recast from graveyard)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Standard common design. Weaker than [[Augur of Autumn]] but appropriate for colorless common.
