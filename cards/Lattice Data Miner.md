## Image Prompt
> Lattice Data Miner, Vedalken Rogue from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Seat of the Synod — plunging into a pool of liquid data, submerged archives visible in the depths. Mood: Exhaustion, grim determination. Pose: Diving headfirst, arms outstretched toward hidden information below. Key visual elements: Chrome skin breaking the data-surface, goggles protecting eyes from information overload, scry-light emanating from discovered secrets. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Mark Tedin. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, deep data-blue, cyan highlights.

## Design Notes
- Blue 2-drop with death trigger
- Scry supports Gamble mechanic
- Good sacrifice fodder
- Pairs with: [[Memory Purge]], [[The Black Ledger]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Skullclamp]] (dies, draws 2, scry 2), Sacrifice outlets ([[Viscera Seer]], etc. - on-demand scry)
- **Potential Combos:** None
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Very standard common. Strictly worse than many existing cards.
