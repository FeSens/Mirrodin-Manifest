## Image Prompt
> The Myr Collective — Artifact. Visual focus: Vast assembly of Myr units physically and digitally linking together. Setting: En-Vidia processing center — the Thought-Sync network hub. Focal point: Myr units sharing data and power streams, unified consciousness emerging, the collective humming with purpose. Mood: False promise. Style reference: Mark Tedin meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Chrome Myr bodies, cyan data streams, cold steel blue.

## Design Notes
- **Myr tribal hub** - connects ALL Myr cards
- Connects: [[Myr Replicant]], [[Simulated Labor Myr]], [[Processing Myr]], [[Foundry Myr]], [[Copper Myr Tender]], [[Myr Fabrication Protocol]]
- Scry trigger synergizes with [[🎲 GAMBLE]], [[The House Edge]]
- Scaling token production rewards Myr density
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The "Aethel-Inference" (The AI Boom & Nvidia)]] - the Myr-Mind
- Pairs with: [[En-Vidia Processing Core]], [[Myr-Sourced Automation]], [[Recursive Self-Improvement]]
