# Escaped Testimony

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Unforged

## Rules Text
> Escaped Testimony enters the battlefield with three testimony counters on it.
>
> Escaped Testimony has protection from legendary creatures as long as it has a testimony counter on it.
>
> Whenever Escaped Testimony deals combat damage to a player, remove a testimony counter from it. That player sacrifices a legendary permanent.

## Flavor Text
> *"They thought silence would protect them. They were wrong."*

## Image Prompt
> Escaped Testimony, Human Unforged from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Fleeing Ep-Styn's Silent Isle — the burning Private Isle behind. Mood: Grim determination. Pose: Striding forward despite wounds, eyes burning with conviction. Key visual elements: Young face with iron-veined scars of survival, metallic hair matted with ash, burning isle reflecting in eyes. Style reference: Rebecca Guay meets Kev Walker. Color palette: White survivor's rags, gold flames behind, bronze wounds.

## Design Notes
- Testimony counters provide protection and fuel revenge
- Forces sacrifice of legendaries (taking down the powerful)
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles counters for more protection/attacks
- The survivor who escaped and spoke
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Great Ep-Styn Mystery]] - survivors who testified
- Pairs with: [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]], [[The Black Ledger]], [[Unforged Witness]], [[Control The Narrative]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Flickerwisp]] / [[Restoration Angel]] (reset counters for repeated legendary removal), Proliferate effects (maintain protection while attacking), [[Sword of Feast and Famine]] (evasion to ensure hits), [[Aqueous Form]] (unblockable for reliable triggers)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Very strong against specific strategies but counters deplete. Interesting anti-legendary hate card.
