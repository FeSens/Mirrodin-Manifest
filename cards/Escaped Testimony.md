# Escaped Testimony

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Unforged

## Rules Text
> Escaped Testimony enters the battlefield with three testimony counters on it.
>
> Escaped Testimony has protection from legendary creatures as long as it has a testimony counter on it.
>
> Whenever Escaped Testimony deals combat damage to a player, remove a testimony counter from it. That player sacrifices a legendary permanent.

## Flavor Text
> *"They thought silence would protect them. They were wrong."*

## Image Prompt
> A determined young figure with burning eyes, striding forward despite wounds. Behind them, the Private Isle burns. Their testimony is their weapon. Justice through survival.

## Design Notes
- Testimony counters provide protection and fuel revenge
- Forces sacrifice of legendaries (taking down the powerful)
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles counters for more protection/attacks
- The survivor who escaped and spoke
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The Great Ep-Styn Mystery]] - survivors who testified
- Pairs with: [[Ep-Styn's Silent Isle]], [[The Black Ledger]], [[Unforged Witness]], [[Control The Narrative]]
