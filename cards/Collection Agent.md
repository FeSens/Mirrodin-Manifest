# Collection Agent

## Card Type Line
Creature — Human Rogue

## Rules Text
> Whenever an opponent sacrifices a [[Debt Token|Debt token]], you draw a card.

## Flavor Text
> *"I'm just here for what's owed."*

## Image Prompt
> Collection Agent, Human Rogue from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: Dross Dominion — debt collection office in the shadows. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Pose: Standing with ledger open, one hand extended for payment. Key visual elements: Dark leather armor with chrome studs, iron-veined face showing cold satisfaction, debtors surrendering possessions behind. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Kev Walker. Color palette: Near-black, dark olive, red ledger accents.

## Design Notes
- Black common creature
- Card draw when opponent's debt comes due
- Triggers when Debt timer runs out (sacrifice)
- Build-around for debt strategies
- Addresses Black common gap
- Pairs with: [[Loan Shark]], [[Master of Debt]], [[Predatory Lending]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** Cards that force opponents to have Debt tokens, [[Tergrid, God of Fright]] (sacrifice synergy)
- **Potential Combos:** None standalone
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Requires Debt token infrastructure. Passive draw is good but narrow.
