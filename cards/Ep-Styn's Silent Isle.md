# Ep-Styn's Silent Isle

## Card Type Line
Legendary Land

## Rules Text
> Ep-Styn's Silent Isle enters tapped unless you control a legendary creature.
>
> {T}: Add {B}.
>
> {2}{B}, {T}: Create a 1/1 black Unforged creature token.
>
> {B}{B}, {T}, Sacrifice an Unforged: Target opponent reveals their hand. You choose a nonland card from it. They discard that card.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Glimmer-Barges arrived full. They left empty. The Ledger grew long."*

## Image Prompt
> Ep-Styn's Silent Isle — Vault of Whispers. Time of day: Sickly twilight, mercury waters reflecting purple sky. Vantage point: From above like Blinkmoth surveillance. Key features: Ominous island with windowless chrome-and-iron temple, single dock with empty Glimmer-Barge, small Unforged figures led up dock in a line. Mood: Institutional horror. Style reference: John Avon meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Near-black iron, tarnished chrome, sickly purple sky, necrogen glow within structure.

## Design Notes
- **Lore connection:** [[Lore#The Great Ep-Styn Mystery]] - This is the Private Isle where Ep-Styn trafficked the Unforged
- Discard no longer scales with secrecy counters — simplified for playability on a land
- Unforged tokens are simple 1/1s; spark counters removed (nothing on this card references them)
- Enters untapped for legendary creatures — the elite always had easy access
- Mythic Rare because it's a central plot location and mechanically powerful
- Pairs thematically with: [[The Black Ledger]], [[Control The Narrative]], [[Unforged Witness]], [[Glimmer-Barge]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Ashnod's Altar]] sacrifice Unforged for mana; [[Blood Artist]]/[[Zulaport Cutthroat]] each death drains; [[Skullclamp]] draw 2 per Unforged
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Pitiless Plunderer]] each Unforged death creates Treasure, funds more token creation; [[Words of Waste]] replace draws with forcing discards; Lands are harder to remove than other permanents
- **Balance Assessment:** FIXED - Removed secrecy counter scaling. Discard still requires sacrificing an Unforged + BB + tap, which is significant cost.
