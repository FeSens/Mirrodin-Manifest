# Ep-Styn's Silent Isle

## Card Type Line
Legendary Land

## Rules Text
> Ep-Styn's Silent Isle enters tapped unless you control a legendary creature.
>
> {T}: Add {B}.
>
> {2}{B}, {T}: Create a 1/1 black Unforged creature token with a spark counter on it and "This creature can't block."
>
> {B}{B}, {T}, Sacrifice an Unforged: Put a secrecy counter on Ep-Styn's Silent Isle. Target opponent reveals their hand. You choose a nonland card from it with mana value less than or equal to the number of secrecy counters on Ep-Styn's Silent Isle. They discard that card.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Glimmer-Barges arrived full. They left empty. The Ledger grew long."*

## Image Prompt
> A small, ominous island rising from the Quicksilver Sea at twilight. The liquid mercury waters reflect a sickly purple sky. At the island's center stands a temple-like structure of tarnished chrome and dark iron, with no windows—only a single dock where a Glimmer-Barge is moored, its hull empty. Strange lights flicker within the structure. The architecture is opulent but deeply wrong, with too many locked doors and winding passages visible in cross-section. Small figures (the Unforged) can be seen being led up the dock in a line. The whole scene is viewed from above, as if from a Blinkmoth's surveillance. Mirrodin metallic aesthetic, dark and unsettling, MTG card art style, ominous atmosphere, the horror hidden in plain sight.

## Design Notes
- **Lore connection:** [[Lore#The Great Ep-Styn Mystery]] - This is the Private Isle where Ep-Styn trafficked the Unforged
- **Counter synergy:** Secrecy counters accumulate, scaling what you can discard
- [[Hype Cycle]] doubles secrecy counters → access to bigger secrets
- [[Compound]] adds secrecy, [[Market Crash]] wipes all secrets (cover-up)
- Unforged tokens now have spark counters for [[Spark Harvester]] synergy
- Enters untapped for legendary creatures — the elite always had easy access
- Mythic Rare because it's a central plot location and mechanically powerful
- Pairs thematically with: [[The Black Ledger]], [[Control The Narrative]], [[Unforged Witness]], [[Glimmer-Barge]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Ashnod's Altar]] sacrifice Unforged for mana; [[Blood Artist]]/[[Zulaport Cutthroat]] each death drains; [[Skullclamp]] draw 2 per Unforged
- **BROKEN COMBOS:** [[Pitiless Plunderer]] each Unforged death creates Treasure, funds more token creation; [[Words of Waste]] replace draws with forcing discards; Lands are harder to remove than other permanents
- **Balance Assessment:** BROKEN - Too many abilities on a land. Lands are harder to remove, and this generates tokens, grows counters, AND provides repeatable discard. Consider making this a legendary artifact instead of a land
