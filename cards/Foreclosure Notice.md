## Image Prompt
> Foreclosure Notice — Enchantment Aura. Visual focus: A creature wrapped in chains made of contract paper, massive FORECLOSURE stamp hovering above ready to strike. Setting: The Great Furnace/Mer-Ikan Foundry — debt processing zone. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Style reference: Nils Hamm meets Greg Staples. Color palette: White contract paper, red FORECLOSURE stamp, near-black chains, bronze victim.

## Design Notes
- Black rare aura
- Recurring debt creation every upkeep
- Draws 2 cards when creature dies (opponent may sacrifice to stop bleeding)
- Creates pressure and card advantage
- Pairs with: [[Loan Shark]], [[Collection Agent]], [[Default Cascade]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Tergrid, God of Fright]] (steal their permanents when they sacrifice to debt), [[The Meathook Massacre]] (drains when they sacrifice), [[Grave Pact]] (forces more sacrifices)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Good rare enchantment. Recurring debt is powerful but 3 mana aura with downside if creature dies is balanced.
