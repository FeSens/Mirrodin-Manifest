# Economic Warfare

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> Whenever an opponent casts their second spell each turn, that player creates a [[Debt Token|Debt token]].

## Flavor Text
> *"Every action has a cost. We ensure they pay it."*

## Image Prompt
> Economic Warfare — Enchantment. Visual focus: A war room of Vedalken strategists manipulating holographic market data, red debt markers spreading across a Mirrodin map like invasion routes. Setting: Seat of the Synod/En-Vidia Lattice — strategic command center. Mood: Corrupted triumph. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Nils Hamm. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, red debt markers on cyan map.

## Design Notes
- Dimir rare enchantment
- Punishes busy turns and storm-style play
- Creates debt pressure over time
- [[Lore]] connection: sanctions and economic pressure
- Pairs with: [[The Sanctions War]], [[Credit Default]]

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Rhystic Study]] (complements spell-taxing strategies), [[Rule of Law]] (locks opponents at one spell per turn to avoid debt OR creating debt), [[Narset, Parter of Veils]] (stax package), [[Notion Thief]] (if debt creation draws cards, this pairs well)
- **Balance Assessment:** Fair - Punishing but not broken. Storm decks hate this, but it requires setup and doesn't immediately win. Good design.
