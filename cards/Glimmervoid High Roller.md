## Card Type Line
Creature — Vedalken Rogue

## Image Prompt
> Glimmervoid High Roller, Vedalken Rogue from Mirrodin Manifest. Setting: The Glimmervoid — an exclusive high-roller's den above the main casino floor. Mood: Corrupted triumph, suspicion. Pose: Seated elegantly at a platinum table, one hand drawing a card while the other gestures dismissively. Key visual elements: Chrome skin with data-filament veins, cards and gold tokens orbiting in calculated patterns, eyes that see probabilities. Style reference: Greg Staples meets Seb McKinnon. Color palette: Steel blue, chrome, gold accents, bright whites.

## Design Notes
- Blue rare creature - addresses Blue rare gap (-1)
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] synergy - massive gamble enabler and payoff
- "Whenever you gamble, draw a card" is extremely powerful
- Activated ability lets you gamble repeatedly (at cost)
- Pairs with [[The House Edge]], [[Chaos Theorist]], [[Profit Taker]]
- Blue angle: gambling for information

## Outside of this set interactions
- **Notable Synergies:** [[Krark's Thumb]] gives 75% win rate + drawing a card on EVERY gamble; [[Chance Encounter]] for rapid luck counter accumulation; [[Alhammarret's Archive]] doubles cards drawn
- **Potential Combos:** [[Intruder Alarm]] + token generators creates infinite gamble/draw loops; [[Mind Over Matter]] discard to untap, gamble, draw to refuel; [[Teferi's Ageless Insight]] draws 2 per gamble
- **Balance Assessment:** FIXED - Added "once each turn" restriction to prevent excessive card advantage loops. Now provides reasonable value for a 4-mana rare.
