**Colors:** Red/Green
**Archetype:** Aggro/Midrange
**Primary Mechanic:** GAMBLE
**Secondary Theme:** High mana value payoffs, Scry manipulation

---

## Deck Strategy

This deck tests the **GAMBLE mechanic** by building around high-impact gamble cards with ways to manipulate the top of your library. The strategy is to:

1. Apply early pressure with aggressive creatures
2. Use scry effects to set up favorable gambles
3. Win gambles to generate extra value (Gold tokens, damage, card advantage)
4. Close games with high-MV threats that also improve gamble win rates

**Key Interaction:** Higher mana value cards = more gamble wins. The deck curves up intentionally.

## Playtest Notes

### What to Test:
- [ ] Does the gamble mechanic feel exciting and skill-testing?
- [ ] Is scry manipulation powerful enough to "rig" gambles?
- [ ] Do high-MV cards feel rewarding for gamble win rates?
- [ ] Is the variance too high or acceptably strategic?
- [ ] Are gamble payoffs appropriately costed?

### Key Plays to Try:
1. Scry with [[Oxidda Processing Gate]], then gamble with a high-MV card on top
2. [[Sylvok Chance-Shaper]] to manipulate both libraries
3. [[Kha-Sino, Fortune's Dealer]] creating Gold tokens on gamble wins
4. [[Jackpot Wurm]] getting massive with gamble triggers

### Watch Out For:
- Games decided purely by luck vs. skill
- Feel-bad moments when losing important gambles
- Whether the deck can function without winning gambles
