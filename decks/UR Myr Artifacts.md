# UR Myr Artifacts

**Colors:** Blue/Red
**Archetype:** Tribal/Tokens
**Primary Mechanic:** Myr tokens, Artifact synergies
**Secondary Theme:** Gold tokens, Sacrifice value

---

## Deck Strategy

This deck tests **Myr tribal** and artifact token synergies. The strategy is to:

1. Generate Myr tokens through various sources
2. Use artifact synergies to amplify Myr value
3. Sacrifice artifacts for value (including Gold tokens)
4. Win through board presence or artifact-based combos

**Key Interaction:** Myr are 1/1 artifact creatures. This makes them count for both creature and artifact synergies, creating powerful overlaps.

## Playtest Notes

### What to Test:
- [ ] Do Myr tokens create a distinct tribal feel?
- [ ] Is the artifact/creature overlap creating good synergies?
- [ ] Are there enough Myr payoffs in the set?
- [ ] Does the token generation feel balanced?
- [ ] Is the deck fun to pilot with lots of small creatures?

### Key Plays to Try:
1. [[Myr Assembly Line]] creating a swarm of Myr
2. [[Myr Fabrication Protocol]] doubling your Myr army
3. Sacrifice Myr to [[Scrap Salvager]] for artifact recursion
4. [[Opposition Leader]] giving your Myr army evasion or buffs

### Watch Out For:
- Whether Myr tokens are impactful enough
- If the deck feels too similar to generic artifact decks
- Board complexity with many small tokens
- Whether there's enough Myr tribal support in the set
