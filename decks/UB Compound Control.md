# UB Compound Control

**Colors:** Blue/Black
**Archetype:** Control/Combo
**Primary Mechanic:** COMPOUND
**Secondary Theme:** Debt tokens, Counter accumulation

---

## Deck Strategy

This deck tests the **COMPOUND mechanic** by building around permanent counter accumulation. The strategy is to:

1. Establish early counter sources (+1/+1, charge, debt counters)
2. Use compound effects to exponentially grow your threats
3. Create Debt tokens for opponents and compound THEIR debt counters
4. Win through overwhelming board presence or opponent life loss from Debt

**Key Interaction:** Compound only works on permanents that already have counters. Sequence matters!

## Playtest Notes

### What to Test:
- [ ] Does compound feel different enough from Proliferate?
- [ ] Is the "one target only" restriction meaningful?
- [ ] Are Debt tokens punishing enough for opponents?
- [ ] Does compounding opponent's Debt feel strategic?
- [ ] Is the counter accumulation too slow or appropriately paced?

### Key Plays to Try:
1. Create Debt for opponent, then compound their Debt tokens
2. [[Lattice Overseer]] compounding your threats each turn
3. [[Recursive Self-Improvement]] creating exponential growth
4. [[Master of Debt]] generating value from Debt sacrifices

### Watch Out For:
- Games where you can't establish initial counters
- Compound being too strong with certain counter types
- Debt tokens feeling unfun for the opponent
- Whether counter tracking becomes cumbersome
