# WU Redistribute Control

**Colors:** White/Blue
**Archetype:** Control
**Primary Mechanic:** REDISTRIBUTE
**Secondary Theme:** Counter manipulation, Defensive play

---

## Deck Strategy

This deck tests the **REDISTRIBUTE mechanic** by building around counter equalization as a control tool. The strategy is to:

1. Let opponents build up counters on their permanents
2. Use redistribute to "tax" their counters (rounding down = net loss)
3. Spread counters to your own permanents for value
4. Control the game through efficient redistribution timing

**Key Interaction:** Redistribute always results in net counter loss due to rounding down. This makes it a form of removal against counter-based threats.

## Playtest Notes

### What to Test:
- [ ] Does redistribute feel like meaningful interaction?
- [ ] Is the "net loss from rounding" clear to players?
- [ ] Can redistribute answer compound-heavy decks?
- [ ] Is targeting opponent's permanents satisfying?
- [ ] Does the mechanic create interesting decision points?

### Key Plays to Try:
1. Opponent has 7 counters, you have 1 → redistribute = both have 4 (they lost 3!)
2. [[Central Planner]] automatically policing counter imbalances
3. [[Memory Normalization]] as instant-speed counter removal
4. Use redistribute to spread -1/-1 counters across enemy creatures

### Watch Out For:
- Whether redistribute feels too similar to removal
- Complexity of tracking counters across multiple permanents
- Games where neither player has counters (mechanic is dead)
- Anti-synergy with your own compound effects
