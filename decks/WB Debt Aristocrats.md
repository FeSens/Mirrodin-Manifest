**Colors:** White/Black

**Primary Mechanic:** Debt Tokens
**Secondary Theme:** Sacrifice triggers, Life drain

---

## Deck Strategy

This deck tests **Debt tokens** and the aristocrats archetype. The strategy is to:

1. Create Debt tokens for yourself and opponents
2. Sacrifice your own Debt tokens before upkeep (avoid life loss)
3. Let opponent's Debt tokens drain their life
4. Use aristocrat payoffs to profit from token deaths

**Key Interaction:** Debt tokens deal damage equal to their debt counters on your upkeep, then sacrifice. You can sacrifice them early to avoid damage, or compound opponent's Debt to increase their pain.

## Playtest Notes

### What to Test:
- [ ] Do Debt tokens create interesting decisions?
- [ ] Is sacrificing Debt before upkeep intuitive?
- [ ] Does giving opponents Debt feel satisfying?
- [ ] Is the life loss from Debt punishing but fair?
- [ ] Do aristocrat payoffs synergize well with Debt?

### Key Plays to Try:
1. Give opponent Debt, compound it, watch them take massive damage
2. Create your own Debt, sacrifice it for value before it hurts you
3. [[Default Cascade]] creating chains of Debt tokens
4. [[Master of Debt]] turning Debt sacrifices into card advantage

### Watch Out For:
- Debt tokens being too confusing (when do they trigger?)
- Games where Debt life loss is too slow
- Whether the sacrifice timing creates memory issues
- Opponent just ignoring Debt because damage is negligible
