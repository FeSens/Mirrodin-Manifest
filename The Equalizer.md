# The Equalizer

## Card Type Line
Creature — Vedalken Advisor

## Rules Text
> Whenever you redistribute, scry 2.
>
> {W}{U}, {T}: Redistribute among any number of target permanents. *(Remove all counters from them, then distribute that many counters among them as you choose.)*
>
> *"Perfect balance requires perfect information."*

## Flavor Text
>

## Image Prompt
> A Vedalken with precisely balanced scales, redistributing glowing counters between two permanents with mathematical precision. Data streams flow behind them.

## Design Notes
- **Redistribute hub** - triggers on ANY redistribute effect
- Connects: [[Redistribute the Wealth]], [[Vindictive Redistribution]], [[Forced Equalization]], [[Grove of Equal Measure]], [[Nature's Rebalancing]], [[Equality Enforcer]], [[Spite Redistributor]], [[The Grand Equalizer]]
- Flexible redistribute ability (not just two permanents)
- Scry triggers synergize with [[🎲 GAMBLE]] and [[The House Edge]]
- Azorius (W/U) for political/bureaucratic theme
- Pairs with [[Central Planner]], [[Mak-Ron, the Glass Orator]]
