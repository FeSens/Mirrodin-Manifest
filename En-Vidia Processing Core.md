# En-Vidia Processing Core

## Card Type Line
Artifact

## Rules Text
> En-Vidia Processing Core enters the battlefield with three charge counters on it.
>
> {T}, Remove a charge counter from En-Vidia Processing Core: Add {C}{C}. Spend this mana only to cast artifact spells or activate abilities of artifacts.
>
> {2}, {T}: Scry 2. If En-Vidia Processing Core has three or more charge counters on it, draw a card.

## Flavor Text
> *"Every mana crystal they mine is another thought we process."*
> — Overseer of the Lattice

## Image Prompt
> A massive crystalline processor core suspended in a web of chrome filaments, pulsing with blue-white energy. Myr workers tend to the cooling systems below while data streams visibly flow through the Lattice connections above. The Seat of the Synod is visible in the background, connected by energy conduits. Electric blues, chrome silvers, and pulsing white energy. MTG card art style, high-tech aesthetic, awe-inspiring scale.

## Design Notes
- Mana acceleration for artifact strategies with charge counter fuel
- **Counter synergy:** [[Hype Cycle]] doubles charges (3→6→12), [[Compound]] adds more
- Scry represents "calculated futures", draw requires maintaining charge
- [[Market Crash]] depletes all charges instantly
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - The En-Vidia Lattice processing units (NVIDIA GPUs)
- Scry 2 synergizes with [[🎲 GAMBLE]] (stack the deck before gambling)
- Enables the artifact-heavy themes of the set
