# En-Vidia Processing Core

## Card Type Line
Artifact

## Rules Text
> {T}: Add {C}{C}. Spend this mana only to cast artifact spells or activate abilities of artifacts.
>
> {2}, {T}: Scry 2, then you may reveal the top card of your library. If an artifact card is revealed this way, draw a card.
>
> *The Lattice doesn't predict the future. It calculates it.*

## Flavor Text
> *"Every mana crystal they mine is another thought we process."*
> — Overseer of the Lattice

## Image Prompt
> A massive crystalline processor core suspended in a web of chrome filaments, pulsing with blue-white energy. Myr workers tend to the cooling systems below while data streams visibly flow through the Lattice connections above. The Seat of the Synod is visible in the background, connected by energy conduits. Electric blues, chrome silvers, and pulsing white energy. MTG card art style, high-tech aesthetic, awe-inspiring scale.

## Design Notes
- Mana acceleration for artifact strategies
- Scry represents "calculated futures"
- Card draw when hitting artifacts rewards dedication
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - The En-Vidia Lattice processing units (NVIDIA GPUs)
- Enables the artifact-heavy themes of the set
