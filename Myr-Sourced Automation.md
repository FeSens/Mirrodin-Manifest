# Myr-Sourced Automation

## Card Type Line
Enchantment

## Rules Text
> When Myr-Sourced Automation enters the battlefield, create two 1/1 colorless Myr artifact creature tokens.
>
> Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, you may tap an untapped Myr you control. If you do, copy that spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.
>
> Non-Myr creatures you control get -1/-1.

## Flavor Text
> *"Efficiency requires displacement."*
> — Core-Logic Directive 7.1

## Image Prompt
> A factory floor where Myr workers seamlessly perform tasks while organic workers stand idle, their tools rusting in their hands. Holographic displays show productivity charts rising while a "workforce reduction" counter ticks upward. The Myr move with perfect synchronization while the displaced workers fade into the background. Cold blues and industrial chrome with warm flesh tones fading to gray. MTG card art style, dystopian automation, job displacement horror.

## Design Notes
- Creates Myr tokens for value
- Myr enable spell copying (AI automation)
- Non-Myr get -1/-1 (organic workers displaced)
- Blue's affinity for artifacts and cost reduction
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - The Myr-Mind automating labor, displacing organic workers
- Build-around for Myr tribal / spellslinger hybrid
