# Rusted Nim Conscript

## Card Type Line
Creature — Nim Zombie Soldier

## Rules Text
> Rusted Nim Conscript enters the battlefield with a rust counter on it.
>
> Rusted Nim Conscript gets -1/-1 for each rust counter on it.
>
> When Rusted Nim Conscript dies, if it had a rust counter on it, return it to the battlefield tapped at the beginning of the next end step.

## Flavor Text
> *"They keep marching. They don't know how to stop."*

## Image Prompt
> A decaying zombie soldier in rusted armor, trudging forward mindlessly. Its equipment is corroded, its eyes empty. Endless conscription.

## Design Notes
- Rust counter weakens but enables recursion
- [[Put-In, the Iron Despot]]'s army flavor
- Counter synergy: [[Hype Cycle]] doubles rust = weaker but still returns
- Endless conscript waves
- Lore connection: [[Lore#The High Artificers (Political Figures)]] - Put-In's endless Nim armies
- Pairs with: [[Put-In, the Iron Despot]], [[Nim Occupation Force]], [[The Sanctions War]]
