# Reckless Wager

## Card Type Line
Sorcery

## Rules Text
> Draw two cards, then discard a card.
>
> Gamble. If you lose the gamble, discard another card.

## Flavor Text
> *"Double or nothing? I'll take those odds."*

## Image Prompt
> A human gambler at a Glimmervoid table, sweating as they draw cards from a chrome deck. Gold tokens pile high, but their hand trembles.

## Design Notes
- Red common sorcery - addresses Red common gap (-16)
- Addresses common creature ratio issue
- [[🎲 GAMBLE]] synergy - card draw with gamble risk
- Pairs with [[The House Edge]], [[Prompt-Sculptor Initiate]] (scry before wagering)
- Rummaging effect is core Red, gamble adds set flavor
- Simple design for NWO compliance

## Cross-Format Interactions
| External Card | Interaction |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Krark's Thumb** | Lets you flip twice and choose - significantly improves gamble odds |
| **Zndrsplt, Eye of Wisdom** | Coin flip synergy (if gamble uses coins) |
| **Chance Encounter** | Adds luck counters on coin flips toward alternate win |
| **Library Manipulation** (Brainstorm, Ponder) | Stack your deck to win the CMC comparison |
| **High CMC Topdecks** (Emrakul, Draco) | Guarantees winning the gamble |
| **Madness Cards** | Discard outlet enables madness if you lose |
| **Hollow One** | Discarding multiple cards reduces Hollow One's cost |

**Format Assessment:**
- **Commander**: Decent card filtering; gamble adds variance that some playgroups enjoy
- **Modern/Legacy**: Compares to Faithless Looting (banned) but with downside variance
- **Limited**: Strong common - floor is still draw 2 discard 2, ceiling is draw 2 discard 1
