# Hype Cycle

## Card Type Line
Enchantment — Saga

## Rules Text
> *(As this Saga enters and after your draw step, add a lore counter. Sacrifice after III.)*
>
> **I** — Double the number of counters on each permanent.
>
> **II** — Double the number of counters on each permanent.
>
> **III** — Remove all counters from all permanents.

## Flavor Text
> *"The Lattice promised infinite growth. It delivered infinite zeroes."*
> — Mak-Ron, surveying the crash

## Image Prompt
> A massive holographic graph projected above the Seat of the Synod, showing an exponential curve rising impossibly high before plummeting to nothing. Vedalken analysts stare in horror as their chrome terminals flicker and die. Shattered mana crystals litter the floor, their glow fading. The En-Vidia Lattice pulses erratically in the background, overloaded nodes burning out one by one. Cool blues and silvers dominating, with harsh red warning lights. MTG card art style, digital painting, dramatic lighting, tech-crash atmosphere, Mirrodin chrome aesthetic.

## Design Notes
- Mechanic: Saga - tells the story of a boom-bust cycle
- Synergy: Explosive with +1/+1 counters, charge counters, loyalty counters
- Risk: Also doubles poison counters, -1/-1 counters on your stuff
- The crash (Chapter III) is symmetrical and devastating
- Lore connection: [[Lore]] - References the En-Vidia Lattice and the "Calculated Futures" that promised everything and delivered collapse
- Mak-Ron (Macron) watches his grand plans evaporate like the Quicksilver Sea
- Perfect satire of tech/crypto hype cycles
